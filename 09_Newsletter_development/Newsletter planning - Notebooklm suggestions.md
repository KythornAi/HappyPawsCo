Newsletter Strategy: The "Launch Sequence"

Since you are collecting emails with a "Get 10% off your first order" incentive, your newsletter needs to immediately deliver value to keep open rates high. For a UK-based shop launching soon, I recommend a 3-part "Welcome Sequence."

Email 1: The "Welcome & Reward" (Send Immediately)
• Subject: Welcome to the Pack! Here is your 10% off code 🐾
• Goal: Immediate conversion.
• Content:
    ◦ Deliver the discount code clearly at the top.
    ◦ Reiterate the brand promise: "Trusted Pet Travel Gear for UK Dogs & Cats".
    ◦ Feature your "Hero" product: The Reflective No-Pull Dog Harness, highlighting its "Padded, Escape-Resist" features.
    ◦ CTA: "Shop Now & Save."

Email 2: The "Problem Solver" (Send 2 Days Later)
• Subject: Is your dog ready for the dark? (Or "Is your car ready for muddy paws?")
• Goal: Education and Trust.
• Content:
    ◦ Do not push for a hard sale. Instead, share a snippet of your blog guides.
    ◦ If it is winter, link to "Staying Visible in the Dark: The Winter Dog Walking Challenge".
    ◦ If it is holiday season, link to "Escaping the Noise... This New Year's Eve".
    ◦ Position HappyPawsCo as an expert in UK pet safety, not just a shop.

Email 3: The "Social Proof" (Send 4 Days Later)
• Subject: Why we started HappyPawsCo...
• Goal: Emotional connection.
• Content:
    ◦ Share the mission story: "Because every journey with your pet deserves to be calm, comfortable and safe".
    ◦ Since you currently have "No reviews", asking for reviews in this email is crucial.
    ◦ Offer: "Love your new gear? Reply to this email or tag us on social media to be featured."

Analogy: Your website is currently like a supermarket where the milk (Car Seat Hammocks) is hidden in the back, and the checkout counter doesn't tell you that buying a chocolate bar would save you the parking fee (Free Shipping threshold). By fixing the signs (navigation) and reminding them about the savings at the till (progress bar), you make it easy for people to fill their baskets.
