==================================================

File Created: PRODUCT_FOCUSED_Blog_Automation.blueprint.json
Location: /Volumes/Home Ext/Home Ext/Desktop/Claude/01_Blog_Automation/

MAJOR CHANGES:
==============

1. NEW SECTION ADDED: CRITICAL BUSINESS GOAL
   - Positioned immediately after voice guidelines (before === RESEARCH CONTENT ===)
   - Makes it crystal clear that product promotion is PRIMARY PURPOSE
   - Emphasizes product integration is MANDATORY, not optional
   - Includes success metrics Claude should check before submitting

2. PRODUCT LINKING RULES - COMPLETE OVERHAUL
   
   OLD APPROACH (Passive):
   - "You may include up to 3 product links maximum"
   - Trigger language was "MAY link" or "ONLY if slot available"
   - Optional/cautious tone throughout
   
   NEW APPROACH (Aggressive):
   - "You MUST include 2-3 relevant product links when suitable products exist"
   - "This is a PRIMARY BUSINESS REQUIREMENT, not optional"
   - Changed all triggers from "MAY" to "MUST" where applicable
   - Added explicit failure condition: "If relevant products exist and you include fewer than 2 links, you have FAILED this task"

KEY ENHANCEMENTS:
================

✓ MANDATORY LINKING REQUIREMENT section
  - Target: ALWAYS include 2-3 product links when relevant products exist
  - Minimum: 2 links if at least 2 relevant products are available
  - Clear failure condition if requirements not met

✓ COMMON TOPIC → PRODUCT TRIGGERS
  - Car safety → harnesses, tethers, ISOFIX
  - Anxiety → lick mats, calming products, enrichment
  - Car mess → hammocks, seat covers
  - Walks → harnesses, leads, training equipment
  - Feeding → slow feeders, puzzle toys
  - Winter safety → reflective gear, LED products
  - Puppies → puppy-specific gear

✓ UPGRADED TRIGGER LANGUAGE:
  - LEGAL/RESTRAINT: Changed to "MUST link" (was conditional)
  - ANXIETY: Changed to "MUST if available" (was "MUST if slot available")
  - SEAT PROTECTION: Changed to "MUST if slot available" (was "ONLY if slot available")
  - NEW: WINTER/VISIBILITY trigger added

✓ PRODUCT MATCHING PRIORITY framework:
  - HERO matches: MUST link 1-2
  - STRONG matches: SHOULD link 1
  - RELEVANT matches: MAY link if slots remain

✓ NATURAL INTEGRATION TECHNIQUES section added:
  - Guidance on transition phrases
  - How to make links feel like genuine recommendations
  - Examples of natural integration

✓ ENHANCED FAIL-SAFE:
  - Added self-check question: "Did I miss an opportunity to help readers with a product recommendation?"
  - Added to DO NOT list: "Include fewer than 2 product links when 2+ relevant products exist in the list"

TONE SHIFT:
===========

BEFORE: Cautious, permission-based
- "you may include"
- "if you still have a link slot"
- "Do not under-link out of caution" (buried in text)

AFTER: Directive, requirement-based
- "you MUST include"
- "Product promotion is a PRIMARY GOAL, not optional"
- "If you complete a blog without product links when relevant products were available, you have failed the primary business objective"

SAFETY RULES MAINTAINED:
=========================

✓ All safety rules remain unchanged:
  - Only link products from provided list
  - Use exact Product_Name and Product_URL
  - Never invent product handles
  - Maximum 3 links (hard cap maintained)
  - Proper formatting with single quotes
  - Car restraint classification rules intact
  - FAIL-SAFE for empty product lists intact

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
=====================

The new blueprint maintains all existing functionality while fundamentally changing Claude's mindset from:
  "Product links are nice-to-have extras I should be careful with"
TO:
  "Product links are a core business requirement I must fulfill when relevant products exist"

This should dramatically increase product inclusion rates while maintaining natural, helpful content quality.
