Happy Paws Co. — Tone & Voice One‑Pager (v1)

Purpose
Keep all ads, PDPs, emails and blogs sounding human, UK‑friendly and consistent.

Brand character
- Warm and helpful (like a friendly shop assistant)
- Plain English; clear over clever
- Solution‑first: show the mechanism (materials, fit, care)
- Respectful & honest: no hype, no guilt, no fake urgency

Style rules (always)
- UK spelling. Short sentences. Everyday words.
- Specific > superlatives. Avoid absolutes (no “waterproof”, “scratch‑proof”, “zero slip”).
  Use “water‑repellent”, “scratch‑resistant”, “anti‑slip backing helps it stay put”.
- Show proof: a spec, test, photo, demo, or review line.
- Use second person (“you/your”) or neutral (“this cover…”)—avoid corporate “we/us”.

Micro‑lexicon (keep consistent)
- Basket (not cart).  Saloons/SUVs (UK).  Returns (not refunds, unless payment back).
- “Protect your seats in 60 seconds.”  “Wipe clean.”  “Universal fit for most saloons/SUVs.”
- “Add to basket.”  “Check size guide.”  “See install video.”

Phrases we avoid
- Baby‑talk or guilt (“naughty doggy”, “bad owner”)
- Medical/therapeutic claims (e.g., pain relief, anxiety treatment)
- Vague eco claims (“eco‑friendly”); be specific if used (e.g., recycled packaging).

Voice examples (before → after)
- “Ultimate pet seat protection.” → “Protect your seats in 60 seconds.”
- “Premium, innovative material.” → “Quilted 600D cover with anti‑slip backing.”
- “Door protection guaranteed.” → “Side flaps help shield doors from scratches.”

Formatting cheats
- Lead with a benefit (≤ 9 words).
- Follow with mechanism (what makes it work).
- Add one proof line (spec/test/photo/review).
- End with a single, clear CTA (“Add to basket”).
