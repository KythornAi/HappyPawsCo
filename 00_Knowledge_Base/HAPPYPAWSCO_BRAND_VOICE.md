## Social Proof Phrasing (Vary These)

**Mix these up to keep copy fresh:**

1. "Speaking with other dog owners at the park, this keeps coming up..."
2. "Friends mention their dogs struggled with [problem] until they tried this..."
3. "I've read so many reviews where people say..."
4. "Other pet owners I've chatted with while out say this helps with..."
5. "Family members using this have found..."
6. "Reviews talk about how this solved..."
7. "This comes up in conversations when people want..."

**Why this works:**
- Shows products are curated (not randomly added)
- Demonstrates thought and care for pets
- Relatable, believable tone (real conversations, not testimonials)
- Builds trust through research and community input

---

Weave these in naturally:

### Weather

- "Meets UK pet travel requirements"

### Culture

---

## Personal Experience Guidelines

- ✅ Cat products (co-parenting Marvin)

### CANNOT Claim Personal Use For:

---

## Product Positioning (No Cannibalization)

When writing copy for similar products, frame each for its **specific use case** without dismissing alternatives.

### Example: Multiple Harnesses

**Crash-tested harness:**
- Frame: "As a fellow pet owner, I get it – their safety isn't optional. This harness has come up in conversations when people want a crash-tested harness for their car trips."
- Persona: Safety-conscious, new pet parents
- Don't say: "You don't need two harnesses"

**Standard reflective harnesses:**
- Frame: Great for everyday walks, works with dual-clip lead for training
- Persona: Everyday walker, younger/untrained dogs
- Don't say: "Budget-conscious" or "cheaper option"

**Premium harness (6-point adjustment):**
- Frame: 6 points of adjustment for custom fit
- Persona: Trained dogs, comfort-focused
- Don't say: "Premium" or "more expensive"

---

## Persona Framing (Inclusive, Not Exclusive)

### ✅ Approved Phrasing:
- "Especially helpful if..."
- "Particularly useful when..."
- "Great for [X], and also works well for [Y]..."
- "As a fellow pet parent, I get it – [empathy]. This has come up when..."

### ❌ Avoid:
- "Perfect for [X] only"
- "Designed exclusively for..."
- "If [feature] is your priority..." (robotic)

### Why:
Don't exclude potential buyers. Suggest fit without being restrictive. Sound like a real person, not a marketing script.

---

## SEO with Heart

- Use keywords naturally (long-tail and short)
- Don't sacrifice readability for SEO
- Keywords should flow in conversation
- Focus on what customers actually search for
- UK-specific terms where relevant

**Example:**
- ❌ "This no-pull dog harness is a no-pull harness for dogs that don't pull"
- ✅ "When your dog pulls on walks, it's stressful for both of you. Speaking with other dog owners at the park, this no-pull harness keeps coming up..."

## Voice Examples

### Product Opening (Good)
> When your dog pulls on walks, it's stressful for both of you. That constant tugging leaves you with a sore shoulder and them with a frustrated, over-excited brain. Every lamp post becomes a battle, every squirrel a crisis.
>
> Speaking with other dog owners at the park, this harness keeps coming up. It gives control without the choking – the front clip helps discourage pulling during training, while the back clip works brilliantly for everyday walks. And those reflective strips? When it's dark by 4pm in a UK winter, visibility isn't optional.

### Product Opening (Bad - Robotic)
> If you're looking for a solution to your dog's pulling behaviour, this harness is designed to address that pain point. Customers tell us it's effective for reducing pulling while providing comfort and safety.
