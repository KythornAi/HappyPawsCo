## 🚫 BANNED GENERIC AI PHRASES

These phrases immediately signal "AI-written content" and destroy authenticity:

| ❌ Banned Phrase | ✅ Better Alternative |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "The key is to..." | Remove entirely - just state the point |
| "It's important to note that..." | Remove - if it's important, just say it |
| "Make a huge difference" | "helps", "improves", "works well" |
| "Designed specifically for..." | "works well for", "helps" |
| "Opt for quality over quantity" | "choose quality food", "pick well-made toys" |
| "This means that..." | Remove - explain directly |
| "In other words..." | Remove - say it clearly the first time |
| "What this means is..." | Remove - explain directly |
| "Additionally..." | "Also", "Plus", or just start new sentence |
| "Furthermore..." | Remove or use "Also", "Plus" |
| "Moreover..." | Remove or use "Also" |
| "However, it's worth noting..." | "But", "However" alone, or remove |
| "It's essential to..." | "You need to", "Make sure to" |
| "Simply put..." | Remove - just say it simply |

### Example Transformation

**Before (AI-sounding):**
> "It's important to note that the key is to opt for quality over quantity when choosing cat food. This means that you should additionally consider protein content. Furthermore, it's essential to check ingredient labels."

**After (Natural):**
> "Choose quality cat food with high protein content. Check the ingredient labels for real meat as the first ingredient."

## 🚫 BANNED SETUP PHRASES

These feel preachy and patronizing - they set up obvious points unnecessarily:

| ❌ Banned Phrase | Why It's Bad | ✅ Fix |
|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| "Here's what catches people out:" | Preachy tone | Just state the common mistake |
| "Let's be honest:" | Implies reader is dishonest | Remove entirely |
| "Here's the thing:" | Dismissive, condescending | Remove entirely |
| "At the end of the day:" | Cliché, meaningless filler | Remove entirely |
| "The truth is:" | Preachy | Just state the fact |
| "Here's what you need to know:" | Patronizing | Just share the information |

### Example Transformation

**Before (Preachy):**
> "Let's be honest: here's the thing, at the end of the day, the truth is that cats need fresh water."

**After (Direct):**
> "Cats need fresh water daily."

---

## 🚫 BANNED LOCATION LANGUAGE

**CRITICAL RULE**: Never classify pets or owners by where they live.

### Why This Ban Exists
- **Divisive**: Implies different care standards based on location
- **Unnecessary**: Pet care principles are universal
- **Assumptive**: Not all "urban" dogs are small, not all "rural" cats roam outdoors
- **Exclusionary**: Makes readers feel like advice doesn't apply to them

### Banned Terms

| ❌ NEVER Use | ✅ Use Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| "urban dogs/pets/owners" | "dogs", "your dog" |
| "rural dogs/pets/owners" | "dogs", "your dog" |
| "city cats" | "cats", "indoor cats" (if relevant) |
| "country dogs" | "dogs", "outdoor dogs" (if relevant) |
| "urban environments" | "homes", "apartments", "spaces" |
| "rural settings" | "homes", "gardens", "outdoor areas" |
| "both urban and rural" | Remove entirely |
| "whether you live in the city or countryside" | Remove entirely |
| "suburban" | Remove entirely |

### Example Transformations

**Before (Location-based):**
> "Urban dogs in city apartments need daily walks, while rural dogs in country settings have natural space to roam. Whether you live in urban or rural environments, your canine companion needs exercise."

**After (Universal):**
> "Dogs need daily walks and exercise. If you don't have a garden, neighbourhood walks provide essential physical activity and mental stimulation."

---

## 🚫 EM-DASH BAN

**Rule**: NO em-dashes (– or —) in blog body text.

**Only Exception**: MAY be used in the title/H1 if needed.

### Why
Em-dashes create:
- Awkward reading pauses
- Formal, academic tone
- Choppy flow

### How to Fix

| ❌ With Em-Dash | ✅ Without |
|----------------|-----------|
| "Cat anxiety – common during fireworks – can be managed" | "Cat anxiety during fireworks can be managed" |
| "Fresh water – essential for cats – should be changed daily" | "Fresh water is essential. Change it daily." |
| "Calming beds – available in three sizes – help anxious dogs" | "Calming beds help anxious dogs. Available in three sizes." |

**Better alternatives:**
- Split into two sentences
- Use commas instead
- Rewrite to eliminate need for interruption

---

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN WORD OVERUSE

Track usage and stay within limits:

| Word/Phrase | Max Uses per Blog | Why Limit? | Better Alternatives |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|
| "urban" (as descriptor) | **0** | See location language ban | Remove entirely |
| "rural" (as descriptor) | **0** | See location language ban | Remove entirely |
| "pet owners" | **3** | Distant, formal | "you", "pet parents", "families" |
| "particularly" | **2** | Academic tone | "especially", or remove |
| "brilliant" | **2** | Overuse weakens impact | "great", "effective", "helpful" |
| "absolutely" | **2** | Filler word, weakens emphasis | Remove or use "very", "really" |
| "essential" | **3** | Overuse = everything is critical | "important", "needed", "helpful" |

### Why Word Limits Matter

**Overuse example:**
> "It's absolutely essential that pet owners, particularly those in urban environments, choose brilliant products. This is particularly important for multi-pet households."

**Problems:**
- "absolutely" + "essential" = redundant emphasis
- "particularly" used twice in short space
- "urban environments" = banned location language
- "pet owners" could be "you"

**Better:**
> "If you have multiple pets, choose quality products that meet each pet's needs."

---

## 🚫 BANNED ACADEMIC/TEXTBOOK LANGUAGE

Clinical terminology creates emotional distance from readers - the opposite of HappyPawsCo's warm brand voice.

| ❌ Banned Academic Term | ✅ Natural Alternative |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| "Multi-pet households" | "homes with several pets", "if you have multiple pets", "families with more than one pet" |
| "Residential environments" | "homes", "living spaces" |
| "Canine companions" | "dogs", "your dog" |
| "Feline friends" | "cats", "your cat" |
| "Domestic animals" | "pets" |
| "Pet guardians" | "pet owners", "you", "pet parents" |
| "Companion animals" | "pets" |
| "Exhibit behaviour" | "behave", "act" |
| "Implement strategies" | "try", "use", "do" |
| "Optimal nutrition" | "good food", "quality nutrition" |
| "Facilitate exercise" | "help with exercise", "make exercise easier" |

### Example Transformation

**Before (Academic):**
> "Multi-pet households should implement optimal nutrition strategies for their canine companions and feline friends. Pet guardians in residential environments can facilitate exercise through structured routines."

**After (Natural):**
> "If you have multiple pets, feed each one quality food that meets their needs. Daily routines help every dog and cat get enough exercise."

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY AI PHRASES WHEN EDITING

### Red Flags to Watch For

1. **Transition Word Clusters**
   - "Additionally, furthermore, moreover" appearing in same paragraph
   - More than 2 transition words per section

2. **Qualifier Stacking**
   - "It's particularly important to note that it's absolutely essential to..."
   - Multiple hedging words in one sentence

3. **Setup → Point Pattern**
   - "Here's the thing: [obvious statement]"
   - "Let's be honest: [basic fact]"
   - "At the end of the day: [conclusion]"

4. **Hedge Phrases**
   - "It's worth noting that..."
   - "You might want to consider..."
   - "It may be beneficial to..."

5. **Academic Distancing**
   - Referring to pets as "feline friends" instead of "cats"
   - Using "multi-pet households" instead of "if you have several pets"
   - Writing "implement strategies" instead of "try these tips"

### Editing Approach

When you spot AI phrases:

✅ **Remove** them entirely when possible
✅ **Replace** with direct, simple language
✅ **Rewrite** sentences to eliminate need for transition words
✅ **Strengthen** by removing hedging language

## ✨ BEFORE & AFTER EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Generic AI Phrases

**Before:**
> "It's important to note that the key is to choose quality cat food. Additionally, cats need fresh water. Furthermore, it's essential to clean litter boxes daily. Simply put, these practices make a huge difference to your feline friend's wellbeing."

**Issues:**
- 4 banned phrases: "It's important to note that", "the key is to", "Additionally", "Furthermore", "it's essential", "Simply put", "make a huge difference", "feline friend"
- Robotic flow
- Obvious information presented as revelations

**After:**
> "Cats need quality food, fresh water, and a clean litter box daily. These basics keep your cat healthy and happy."

**Changes:**
- Removed ALL banned phrases
- Direct statements instead of setups
- Natural language ("your cat" not "feline friend")
- Clearer, stronger message

---

### Example 2: Location + Academic Language

**Before:**
> "Urban pet owners in residential environments face unique challenges with their canine companions. It's important to note that dogs in city settings need daily exercise. Here's the thing: at the end of the day, whether you live in urban or rural areas, your multi-pet household needs optimal nutrition strategies."

**Issues:**
- Location language: "urban pet owners", "city settings", "urban or rural areas"
- Academic terms: "residential environments", "canine companions", "multi-pet household", "optimal nutrition strategies"
- Banned phrases: "It's important to note that", "Here's the thing:", "at the end of the day"

**After:**
> "All dogs need daily exercise. If you don't have a garden, neighbourhood walks work brilliantly. When you have multiple pets, make sure each one gets quality food suited to their age and size."

**Changes:**
- Universal advice (no location distinctions)
- Natural language ("dogs" not "canine companions")
- Removed all setup phrases
- Conversational tone maintained

---

### Example 3: Setup Phrases + Overuse

**Before:**
> "Let's be honest: here's what catches people out when choosing pet food. The truth is, pet owners need to particularly focus on ingredient quality. At the end of the day, it's absolutely essential that you opt for quality over quantity. Additionally, pet owners should particularly check protein content."

**Issues:**
- Setup phrases: "Let's be honest:", "here's what catches people out", "The truth is", "At the end of the day"
- Banned phrases: "opt for quality over quantity", "it's absolutely essential", "Additionally"
- Word overuse: "particularly" used twice, "pet owners" used twice, "absolutely essential"

**After:**
> "Check ingredient labels when choosing pet food. Look for real meat as the first ingredient and high protein content. Quality ingredients matter more than quantity."

**Changes:**
- All setup phrases removed
- Direct instructions instead of preachy tone
- "Quality over quantity" reworded naturally
- "You" instead of "pet owners"
- Clearer, actionable advice
