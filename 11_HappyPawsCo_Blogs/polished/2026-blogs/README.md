# Polished Blogs - 2026

Blog Publisher Agent outputs awaiting your review.

## What Goes Here
- Blogs polished by the Blog Publisher Agent
- Image prompts from Image Prompter Agent
- Images generated from Vertex AI
- Waiting for your proofread and final approval

## Folder Structure

Each blog has its own complete folder:

```
polished/2026-blogs/
└── blog-title-slug/
    ├── published.html        # Polished HTML from Blog Publisher Agent
    ├── image-prompts.md      # Image prompts from Image Prompter Agent
    └── images/               # Generated images from Vertex AI
        ├── image-1.png
        ├── image-2.png
        └── ...
```

## Your Task

1. Proofread `published.html`
2. Review images
3. If approved → manually move entire folder to `published/2026-blogs/`

## Next Step

After your review and approval:
- Move entire blog folder to `published/2026-blogs/[blog-slug]/`
- Then copy/paste HTML to Shopify (manual for now)
