## Generation Tips

**For Google Vertex AI (Imagen 3):**
- Copy Primary Prompt directly into the prompt field
- Set image quality to highest available setting
- Generate 2-3 variations of each prompt to choose the best composition
- Imagen 3 excels at photorealism and natural lighting, which matches HappyPawsCo's brand perfectly
- Aspect ratio options: Use 16:9 for hero, 1:1 or 4:3 for section images

**If using Midjourney as backup:**
- Use Alternative Prompts where provided
- Add parameters: `--ar 16:9 --v 6 --style raw` for hero image
- Add parameters: `--ar 1:1 --v 6 --style raw` for section images
- Use `--s 250` for moderate stylization (keeps it photorealistic)

**If using DALL-E 3:**
- Primary Prompts work well, may need slight simplification if they exceed character limits
- Generate at highest resolution (1024x1024 square, or use new wider formats if available)
- DALL-E 3 handles "photorealistic UK home" descriptions very effectively
