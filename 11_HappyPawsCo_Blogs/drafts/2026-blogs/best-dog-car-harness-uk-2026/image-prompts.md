## Generation Tips

**For Vertex AI:**
- Copy Primary Prompt directly
- Adjust quality settings: High resolution, photorealistic
- Generate 2-3 variations, choose best
- Request 1024x1024 or higher resolution

**For Midjourney:**
- Use Alternative Prompt if Primary doesn't work
- Add parameters: `--ar 16:9 --v 6 --style raw` for photorealism
- Use `--s 250` for moderate stylization
- For comparison image: `--ar 16:9 --style raw`

**For DALL-E:**
- Use Primary Prompt, keep under 400 characters if needed
- Generate in 1024x1024, then crop to desired ratio
- Request "photorealistic" or "high quality photography" explicitly

- Weather through windows should be typical British (grey/overcast acceptable)
- Avoid obviously American car interiors or settings
