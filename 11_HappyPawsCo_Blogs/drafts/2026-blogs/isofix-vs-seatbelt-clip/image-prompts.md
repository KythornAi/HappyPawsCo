## Generation Tips

**For Google Vertex AI:**
- Copy Primary Prompt directly
- Adjust quality settings: High resolution, photorealistic
- Generate 2-3 variations, choose best
- For the comparison diagram, may need to iterate or simplify

**For Midjourney (if using for diagram):**
- Use: `--ar 16:9 --v 6 --style raw`
- Add `--s 250` for moderate stylization
- Good for infographic if Vertex AI struggles with text/diagrams

**For DALL-E:**
- Use Primary Prompt, may need to shorten if over character limit
- Generate in 1024x1024, then crop to desired ratio
- Request "photorealistic" or "high quality photography" explicitly

## Additional Notes

**UK-Specific Details to Verify:**
- Car interiors should look British (right-hand drive if visible)
- Avoid obviously American styling or brands
- Natural UK lighting (can include grey skies through windows)

**Dog Breed Mix:**
- Hero: Golden Retriever (popular UK breed)
- Seatbelt clip section: Border Collie (another popular UK breed)
- Harness section: Labrador Retriever (UK's most popular breed)
- This provides visual variety while staying on-brand

**Safety Messaging:**
- All images show dogs properly secured
- No images of dogs loose in cars or unsafe setups
- Harnesses shown fitted correctly (not too loose)
