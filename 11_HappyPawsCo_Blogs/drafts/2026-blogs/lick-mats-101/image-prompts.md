## Notes on Image Selection

**Why these four images:**
1. **Hero (Dog in bathroom)** - Immediately shows lick mat in action during grooming, one of the key use cases
2. **Calming section (Relaxed cat)** - Demonstrates the calming benefit with a visibly relaxed pet
3. **Enrichment section (Preparation)** - Shows the practical "how to" element and the rainy day context
4. **Safe foods (Flat lay)** - Educational content that helps readers identify safe options

**Dog/Cat Balance:**
- Hero: Dog
- Section 1: Cat
- Section 2: Human hands (neutral)
- Section 3: Food (neutral)

This maintains HappyPawsCo's inclusive approach to both dogs and cats.

**UK-Specific Elements Included:**
- British Shorthair cat breed
- UK bathroom styling (white subway tiles)
- Rainy weather through window
- British kitchen aesthetic
- Neutral/Scandinavian interior design
