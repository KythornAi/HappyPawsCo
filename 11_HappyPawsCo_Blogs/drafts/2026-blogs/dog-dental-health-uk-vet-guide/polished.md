## The Content

You brush your teeth twice a day without thinking about it, but when was the last time you checked inside your dog's mouth? Most of us don't, and that's completely normal. Dog dental health isn't exactly the most glamorous topic, but it's one of those things that quietly affects everything from their breath to their overall wellbeing. By the time you notice a problem, it's often been brewing for months or even years.

Dental disease is surprisingly common in dogs across the UK, and it's not just about bad breath or yellow teeth. Left unchecked, it can lead to pain, infections, and even affect vital organs like the heart and kidneys. The good news is that with a bit of regular attention, you can help your dog avoid most dental problems entirely. It doesn't require expensive equipment or complicated routines, just some basic knowledge and consistency.

This guide covers why dental health matters, what to watch for, and practical steps you can take at home to keep your dog's teeth and gums healthy. Whether you've got a puppy who's never had their teeth brushed or an older dog with a bit of tartar buildup, there's plenty you can do to make a difference.

## What Actually Happens When Dental Health Is Ignored

When food particles and bacteria build up on your dog's teeth, they form a sticky film called plaque. If plaque isn't removed through brushing or chewing, it hardens into tartar within a few days. Tartar is that yellowish-brown crust you might see along the gumline, and once it's there, it can only be removed by a vet.

As tartar accumulates, it pushes under the gumline and irritates the surrounding tissue. This causes gingivitis, which is inflammation of the gums. You might notice redness, swelling, or bleeding when your dog chews. At this stage, the damage is still reversible with professional cleaning and a better home care routine.

If gingivitis progresses, it becomes periodontal disease. The infection spreads deeper, damaging the bone and ligaments that hold teeth in place. Teeth can become loose or fall out, and abscesses can form. This is painful, though many dogs won't show obvious signs of discomfort until the problem is quite advanced. They're remarkably good at hiding pain, which is why regular checks are so important.

Beyond the mouth, bacteria from dental infections can enter the bloodstream and affect other organs. Studies have shown links between severe periodontal disease and heart, liver, and kidney problems in dogs. It's not just about keeping their teeth white, it's about protecting their long-term health.

## Signs Your Dog Might Have Dental Problems

Dogs rarely complain about toothache, so it's up to you to spot the warning signs. Some are obvious, others are surprisingly subtle. If you notice any of these, it's worth booking a vet check to see what's going on.

- **Bad breath:** A bit of doggy breath is normal, but a strong, unpleasant smell often signals infection or decay. If it smells noticeably worse than usual, don't ignore it.
- **Yellow or brown buildup:** Tartar is easy to spot along the gumline, especially on the back teeth. Even a small amount means plaque has been sitting there long enough to harden.
- **Red or swollen gums:** Healthy gums should be pink and firm. If they're red, puffy, or bleed when touched, that's a sign of inflammation.
- **Difficulty eating:** Dropping food, chewing on one side, or suddenly refusing hard kibble can all indicate mouth pain. Some dogs will still eat enthusiastically despite discomfort, so watch how they chew, not just whether they eat.
- **Pawing at the mouth:** If your dog keeps rubbing their face or pawing at their mouth, they might be trying to relieve pain or dislodge something uncomfortable.
- **Excessive drooling:** More saliva than usual, especially if it's tinged with blood, often points to dental issues.

## Breeds and Ages Most at Risk

Some dogs are more prone to dental problems than others. Small breeds like Yorkshire Terriers, Chihuahuas, and Dachshunds tend to have crowded teeth, which makes plaque buildup easier and cleaning harder. Toy breeds often develop dental disease earlier in life than larger dogs.

Brachycephalic breeds (those with flat faces like Pugs and French Bulldogs) also face challenges. Their shortened jaws can lead to overcrowding and misalignment, creating spaces where food and bacteria get trapped. Regular dental checks are especially important for these dogs.

Age plays a role too. Puppies start with clean teeth, but without proper care, plaque begins accumulating as soon as their adult teeth come in. By the time many dogs reach middle age, some level of dental disease is present. Older dogs are at higher risk simply because they've had more time for problems to develop, and their immune systems may be less effective at fighting infections.

## What You Can Do at Home

Prevention is far easier (and cheaper) than treatment. A consistent home care routine can dramatically reduce your dog's risk of dental disease. It doesn't have to be complicated, but it does need to happen regularly.

### Brushing Your Dog's Teeth

Daily brushing is the gold standard for dental care. It removes plaque before it hardens into tartar, keeping gums healthy and breath fresher. Use a dog-specific toothbrush and toothpaste (never human toothpaste, which contains ingredients that are toxic to dogs).

Start slowly if your dog isn't used to it. Let them taste the toothpaste first, then gently lift their lip and brush just a few teeth. Gradually build up to a full brushing session over several days or weeks. Focus on the outer surfaces of the teeth, especially the back molars where tartar builds up fastest. Most dogs tolerate this better than you'd expect once they're used to the routine.

### Dental Chews and Toys

Chewing helps scrape away plaque mechanically, and certain dental chews are designed to do this more effectively. Look for products approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC), which tests and endorses products proven to reduce plaque or tartar.

Dental chews aren't a replacement for brushing, but they're a useful addition. Choose the right size for your dog and supervise them while they chew. Avoid anything too hard (like antlers or bones), which can crack teeth. A good rule is that if you can't indent it with your thumbnail, it's probably too hard.

### Diet and Dental Health

Some dry kibble is designed with dental benefits in mind. The larger, crunchy pieces help scrape teeth as your dog chews. Wet food, on the other hand, tends to stick to teeth more easily and doesn't provide the same mechanical cleaning action. If your dog eats mostly wet food, brushing becomes even more important.

Avoid giving your dog sugary treats or human foods that promote plaque buildup. Stick to dog-safe options, and if you're using treats for training, factor them into their daily calorie intake to avoid weight gain, which brings its own health challenges.

## When to See a Vet

Even with excellent home care, professional dental cleanings are sometimes necessary. Vets can remove tartar that's already formed and check for problems you might not spot yourself, like loose teeth or early signs of decay.

Most vets recommend a dental check at least once a year as part of your dog's annual health exam. If your dog has existing dental issues or is at higher risk, they may suggest more frequent visits. Don't wait until your dog is in obvious pain. By that point, the problem is often advanced and more difficult (and expensive) to treat.

Professional cleanings are done under general anaesthetic, which allows the vet to thoroughly clean below the gumline and assess each tooth properly. It's the only way to remove tartar that's already hardened and to address any underlying issues. While anaesthesia always carries some risk, modern veterinary practices are very experienced at managing it safely, even for older dogs.

## The Cost of Dental Care in the UK

Dental treatments can be one of the more expensive aspects of dog ownership, especially if problems have been left to develop. A professional cleaning typically costs between £150 and £500, depending on the extent of tartar buildup and whether extractions are needed. Severe cases requiring multiple extractions or advanced periodontal treatment can run higher.

Prevention is far more affordable. A dog toothbrush and toothpaste cost around £5 to £10, and dental chews are usually £10 to £20 for a month's supply. Investing a little time and money upfront can save you significant vet bills later, not to mention sparing your dog the discomfort of dental disease.

Pet insurance policies vary in what they cover. Some include dental treatment if it's the result of an accident or illness, but routine cleanings or issues caused by lack of preventive care are often excluded. Always check your policy details, and if dental cover is important to you, look for insurers who specifically include it.

## Common Myths About Dog Dental Health

There's a lot of misinformation floating around about what works and what doesn't. Let's clear up a few common myths.

**Myth: Dogs don't need their teeth brushed because they're naturally clean.** This isn't true. Wild canids might chew on raw bones and tough materials that help keep their teeth cleaner, but domestic dogs eating commercial diets don't get the same benefit. Without intervention, plaque and tartar will build up just like they do in humans.

**Myth: Bad breath is just part of having a dog.** A little doggy breath is normal, but strong, foul-smelling breath is a sign of dental disease or other health issues. It's not something you should accept as inevitable.

**Myth: Dry food alone will keep teeth clean.** While some dry kibble can help, it's not enough on its own. Many dogs swallow kibble whole or chew it minimally, so it doesn't provide much cleaning action. Brushing is still the most effective way to prevent plaque buildup.

**Myth: Older dogs don't need dental care because they're already losing teeth.** Older dogs benefit from dental care just as much as younger ones. Keeping their remaining teeth healthy improves their quality of life and helps them eat comfortably.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use human toothpaste on my dog?

Never use human toothpaste on your dog. It contains fluoride and other ingredients that are toxic to dogs if swallowed. Dog toothpaste is formulated to be safe for them to ingest and often comes in flavours like chicken or beef, which makes brushing more appealing for your dog.

### What if my dog won't let me brush their teeth?

Start slowly and make it a positive experience. Let them lick the toothpaste off your finger first, then gradually introduce the toothbrush. Use lots of praise and treats to build a positive association. If they're really resistant, try dental wipes or a finger brush as an easier alternative. Consistency and patience are key, and most dogs will tolerate it once they're used to the routine.

### How often should my dog have a professional dental cleaning?

It depends on your dog's individual needs, but most vets recommend a professional cleaning every one to three years. Dogs with good home care and no existing problems may go longer between cleanings, while those with a history of dental disease may need more frequent attention. Your vet will advise based on your dog's specific situation during their annual check-up.

### Are dental chews as effective as brushing?

Dental chews can help reduce plaque and tartar, but they're not as effective as brushing. Think of them as a supplement to, not a replacement for, regular brushing. They're useful for dogs who won't tolerate brushing or as an additional tool in your dental care routine. Look for VOHC-approved products for the best results.

### At what age should I start brushing my dog's teeth?

The earlier the better. Ideally, start when your dog is a puppy so they grow up accepting it as part of their routine. However, it's never too late to begin. Adult and senior dogs can learn to tolerate brushing with patience and positive reinforcement. The key is making it a gradual, positive experience regardless of when you start.

---

**Summary:** Dog dental health is about more than fresh breath. It affects their comfort, eating ability, and overall wellbeing. Regular brushing, appropriate chews, and professional cleanings when needed can prevent most dental problems and keep your dog healthier for longer.
