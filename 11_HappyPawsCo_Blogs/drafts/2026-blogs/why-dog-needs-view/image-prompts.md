## Generation Tips

### For Google Vertex AI:
- Copy Primary Prompt directly
- Use "Imagen 3" model for best photorealism
- Generate 3-4 variations, choose best
- Check for realistic UK car interiors (right-hand drive visible in some shots)

### For Midjourney:
- Add parameters: `--ar 16:9 --v 6 --style raw` for photorealism
- Use `--s 150` for moderate stylization
- For the diagram: use `--style raw` and specify "clean infographic"

### For DALL-E:
- Use Primary Prompt, keep under 400 characters if needed
- Generate in 1024x1024, then crop to desired ratio
- Specify "photorealistic photography" explicitly

- **Problem:** Dachshund (recognisably small, common choice)
- **Product:** Chihuahua (very small, clearly benefits from booster)
