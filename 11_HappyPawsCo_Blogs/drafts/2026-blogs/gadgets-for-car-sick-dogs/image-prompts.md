## Generation Tips

**For Google Vertex AI:**
- Copy Primary Prompt directly
- Set quality to high resolution, photorealistic style
- Generate 2-3 variations and select best match
- Check that dogs look healthy and not overly distressed (especially for anxiety image)

**For DALL-E:**
- Use Primary Prompt, adjust length if needed
- Generate in 1024x1024, then crop to desired ratio
- Include "photorealistic" explicitly

**Quality Checks:**
- Ensure UK settings (left-hand drive cars won't work for UK audience)
- Dogs should look relatable and realistic
- Avoid overly staged or stock photo aesthetic
- Check that anxiety image shows mild discomfort, not severe distress

## Next Steps

1. Copy prompts to Google Vertex AI
2. Generate 2-3 variations of each image
3. Select best version that matches brand aesthetic
4. Rename files to suggested filenames
5. Compress to ~200-300KB for web
6. Insert into blog at recommended placements
7. Add alt text to each image tag
8. Review blog with images before publishing

**Note:** For the anxiety signs image (Image 2), be careful that the dog doesn't look severely distressed. We want to show mild discomfort to help readers identify signs, not upset anyone viewing the blog. A dog with ears slightly back and wide eyes is sufficient.
