**For Midjourney:**
- Use Alternative Prompt if available
- Add parameters: `--ar 16:9 --v 6 --style raw` for photorealism
- Use `--s 250` for moderate stylization

**For DALL-E:**
- Use Primary Prompt, trim if over 400 characters
- Generate in 1024x1024, then crop to desired ratio
- Include "photorealistic" or "professional photography" explicitly
