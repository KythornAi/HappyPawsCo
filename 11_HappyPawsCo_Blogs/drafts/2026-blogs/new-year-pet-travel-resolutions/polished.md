January feels like a fresh start, doesn't it? A chance to reset, rethink, and maybe tackle some of those things you've been putting off. If you're a dog owner who loves exploring new places together, this might be the perfect time to set a few travel resolutions that'll make 2026 your best year yet for adventures with your four-legged companion. Whether you're planning weekend trips to the Peak District or just want calmer journeys to the local park, small improvements now can make a real difference to how much you both enjoy getting out and about.

## Resolution 1: Upgrade Your In-Car Safety Setup

Here's something many of us don't think about until we're halfway down the motorway and our dog's slipped into the footwell again. Keeping your dog properly restrained in the car isn't just about following the law (though that matters too). It's about making sure they're safe if you need to brake suddenly, and that you're not distracted by a restless passenger trying to climb into the front seat.

The Highway Code is clear on this. [Rule 57](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-highway-code) states that dogs must be suitably restrained in vehicles so they can't distract you or injure anyone if you stop quickly. That means a proper harness with a seatbelt tether, a secure carrier, or a crate. It's not about being overly cautious. It's about protecting them and everyone else in the car.

If you've been relying on your dog sitting nicely on the back seat without any restraint, this year is a good time to change that. The [Kurgo Enhanced Strength Tru-Fit Crash-Tested Dog Car Harness](/products/kurgo-enhanced-strength-tru-fit-dog-car-harness-crash-tested-steel-nesting-buckles-includes-seatbelt-tether-medium-black) is designed specifically for car travel, with padded chest support and steel buckles for durability. It also comes with a seatbelt tether included, so you've got everything you need in one go.

For an even more secure connection, consider the [ISOFIX/LATCH Swivel Seat-Belt Tether](/products/isofix-latch-swivel-seat-belt-tether-metal-carabiner-shock-absorb-happypawsco-uk), which connects directly to your car's frame using the same anchor points designed for child car seats. The swivel design prevents tangling, and the metal carabiner adds an extra layer of security. Pair it with a well-fitted harness, and you've got a setup that gives you real peace of mind on longer journeys.

### Protecting Your Seats Without Compromising Safety

Restraints keep your dog safe, but they don't stop muddy paws from wrecking your upholstery. That's where a good seat cover comes in. The [Lite 3-Layer Car Seat Hammock](/products/lite-car-seat-hammock-3-layer) is waterproof and quilted, designed to protect your back seat from mud, wet coats, and general dog-related chaos. It's not a restraint, so you'll still need a harness and tether, but it makes post-walk clean-ups far less stressful.

If you've got a smaller dog who struggles to settle during car journeys, an elevated booster seat can help them feel more secure. Being able to see out of the window often calms anxious travellers. The [Elevated View Dog Booster Seat](/products/elevated-view-dog-booster-seat-grey-m-harness-clips-up-to-11kg-happypawsco-uk) includes harness clips for safety and a waterproof outer layer for practicality. It's designed for dogs up to 11kg and folds flat when not in use.

## Resolution 2: Make Every Walk More Enjoyable

Walks shouldn't feel like a battle. If your dog pulls constantly or you're struggling to keep them focused on busy pavements, it's easy to start dreading what should be the best part of your day together. The good news is that better equipment and a bit of consistency can transform your daily walks without needing a complete training overhaul.

A front-clip harness changes the game for dogs who pull. When your dog lunges forward, the front attachment gently redirects them back towards you rather than letting them power ahead. It's not a magic fix, but it makes training so much easier. The [Rabbitgoo Reflective No-Pull Dog Harness](/products/dog-harness-medium-no-pull-pet-harness-with-2-leash-clips-adjustable-soft-padded-pet-vest-harness-reflective-no-choke-with-easy-control-handle-for-training-or-walking-black-m) has both front and back clips, so you can use the front for training sessions and switch to the back clip once your dog's walking calmly. The reflective trim is brilliant for those darker January evenings when visibility matters.

If you're working on recall or just want more freedom in open spaces, a retractable lead gives your dog room to explore without you losing control. The [Pecute 8m Retractable Dog Lead](/products/pecute-8m-retractable-dog-lead-anti-chew) features an anti-chew cable and a one-handed brake, so you can quickly shorten the lead if another dog appears or you're approaching a road.

### Training Leads for Better Control

For dogs who need a bit more structured guidance, a two-point training lead can be really helpful. These clip to both the front and back of a harness, giving you better steering and reducing pulling without yanking your dog around. The [Two-Point Control Dog Lead](/products/point-control-dog-lead-works-with-no-pull-harnesses-no-tangle-training-leads-soft-padded-and-reflective-walking-lead-converts-to-single-lead-for-medium-large-dogs-brown) works perfectly with no-pull harnesses and has reflective stitching for safer walks when it gets dark early.

Consistency matters more than perfection. If you commit to using the same equipment and rewarding calm walking every time you head out, you'll start to see real progress. Your dog wants to enjoy walks just as much as you do. Sometimes they just need a bit of help understanding what you're asking for.

## Resolution 3: Be Ready for Anything on Adventures

There's nothing worse than being miles from home when something goes wrong and realising you're completely unprepared. Whether it's a cut paw on a coastal walk or your dog overheating on an unexpectedly warm day, having the right kit with you makes all the difference.

A compact first aid kit designed for pets is one of those things you hope you'll never need but feel so much better having. The [Mini Pet First Aid Kit](/products/mini-pet-first-aid-kit-vet-designed-happypawsco) includes 34 vet-designed essentials and comes with QR-linked video guides, so even if you're not sure what to do, you've got clear instructions to hand. It's small enough to fit in a backpack or glove box and covers everything from minor cuts to emergency situations.

### Hydration and Comfort on Longer Trips

Dogs overheat faster than we realise, especially if they're excited and running around. Carrying water isn't enough. You need a way for them to drink it easily. The [Stainless Steel Pet Water Bottle](/products/stainless-steel-pet-water-bottle-800-ml-grey) has a built-in bowl and keeps water cool even on warmer days. It's insulated, leak-proof, and clips onto your bag or belt, so you've always got hydration sorted.

If you're heading out for a full day, collapsible bowls are a lifesaver. The [Collapsible Travel Bowls](/products/collapsible-dog-bowls-with-bottle-carrier-2-pack-travel-dog-water-bowl-with-upgraded-carabiner-one-piece-molded-rim-no-fall-off-or-crack-gray-pink-largepack-of-2) come in a two-pack, so you can use one for water and one for food if needed. They fold flat, have an integrated hard rim so they don't collapse when full, and include upgraded carabiners with larger openings for easier clipping.

Don't forget the less glamorous essentials. Muddy paws and grubby coats are part of the deal when you're out exploring, and nobody wants to spend the drive home with a car that smells like wet dog and regret. [Pet Wipes](/products/pet-wipes-for-dogs-hypoallergenic-cleaning-and-hydrating-for-grooming-paws-body-and-bums-unscented-100-count) are brilliant for quick clean-ups before loading your dog back into the car. They're hypoallergenic, unscented, and contain aloe and chamomile, so they're gentle enough for regular use.

## Resolution 4: Explore New Places Together

It's easy to fall into a routine, walking the same loop around the local park week after week. But dogs thrive on new experiences, and so do we. This year, make it a goal to visit at least one new place each month. It doesn't have to be a grand expedition. Even a different woodland trail or a new village with a dog-friendly pub counts.

If you're planning longer trips, preparation makes everything smoother. Check ahead to make sure your destination genuinely welcomes dogs. Some places say they're dog-friendly but really mean 'we'll tolerate them if they're invisible and silent'. Look for spots that actively cater to dogs, with water bowls, treats at the bar, and outdoor space where they can relax.

### Building Confidence Through Variety

Introducing your dog to different environments helps them become more adaptable and confident. A dog who's only ever walked in quiet suburban streets might find a busy market town overwhelming. But if you gradually expose them to new sights, sounds, and smells, they learn to take it all in their stride.

Start small if your dog is nervous. A quiet car park, a calm beach out of season, or a less-travelled footpath can all be good stepping stones. Reward calm behaviour with treats and praise, and don't rush them. Some dogs need more time to adjust than others, and that's completely normal.

### Your Adventure Packing Checklist

Never get caught out again. Here's what to bring on every outing:

**Essentials (every trip):**
- Lead and harness
- Water bottle and collapsible bowl
- Poo bags
- Treats for rewards
- Pet wipes

**Longer adventures:**
- First aid kit
- Spare lead
- Extra water
- Towel for drying off

**Hot weather:**
- Cooling mat or wet towel
- Extra water (double your usual amount)

**Cold weather:**
- Dog coat for short-haired breeds
- Paw balm for icy conditions

## Making Resolutions Stick

The trouble with resolutions is that they often fizzle out by February. The trick is to make them manageable. You don't need to overhaul everything overnight. Pick one resolution to start with, get that sorted, then move on to the next.

If upgrading your car safety feels like the most important thing, focus on that first. Get a proper harness and tether fitted, make sure your dog's comfortable wearing them, and practise a few short journeys before tackling anything longer. Once that's sorted, you can think about improving your walking setup or planning new adventures.

Write down what you want to achieve and why it matters. Maybe it's 'I want to feel confident driving with my dog on the motorway' or 'I want walks to be enjoyable instead of stressful'. Having a clear reason makes it easier to stay motivated when life gets busy and it's tempting to skip things.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I really need a crash-tested harness for car journeys?

Crash-testing isn't a legal requirement in the UK, but it does give you more confidence that the harness will hold up in a sudden stop or accident. The Highway Code requires dogs to be suitably restrained, and a well-fitted harness with a seatbelt tether meets that standard. Crash-tested harnesses have been through additional testing to check their strength and performance, which can offer extra reassurance. If you travel frequently or do long motorway journeys, it's worth considering.

### Can I use a retractable lead for training?

Retractable leads are brilliant for giving your dog freedom in open spaces, but they're not ideal for teaching loose-lead walking. The constant tension on the lead can actually encourage pulling because your dog learns that pulling gets them further away. For training, a standard lead or a two-point training lead works better because you have more control and can reward your dog for staying close. Once your dog's walking calmly, you can use a retractable lead for off-lead-style exploring in safe areas.

### How often should I take my dog somewhere new?

There's no magic number, but once a month is a good target if you want to keep things interesting without overwhelming yourself or your dog. New environments provide mental stimulation and help build confidence, but they can also be tiring. Balance new adventures with familiar, relaxing walks so your dog has time to decompress. If your dog is nervous or reactive, go at their pace and choose quieter spots until they're more comfortable with change.

### What should I pack for a day out with my dog?

At a minimum, bring a lead, harness, water, a collapsible bowl, poo bags, and some treats. If you're heading somewhere remote or planning a long walk, add a first aid kit, pet wipes, a spare lead, and extra water. In hot weather, bring a cooling mat or wet towel. In cold weather, consider a coat for short-haired breeds. A small towel for drying off muddy paws is always useful, especially if you're getting back in the car afterwards.

**Summary:** Start 2026 with resolutions that make travel safer, walks more enjoyable, and adventures more memorable for you and your dog. Small changes like upgrading your car safety setup, improving your walking gear, and being prepared for anything can transform how much you both enjoy getting out together.
