## Notes on This Blog's Visual Needs

1. **Car Interior Focus:** Most images need authentic UK car interiors. Avoid American-style vehicles (large SUVs, pickup trucks) or obvious left-hand drive vehicles.

2. **Small Dog Breeds:** Use recognisable small breeds (Jack Russell, Chihuahua, Shih Tzu, Yorkshire Terrier, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Pomeranian) rather than generic small dogs.

3. **Safety Emphasis:** Each image should subtly reinforce the safety message - harness connections visible, crates properly secured, dogs looking calm and comfortable.

4. **No Distress:** Dogs should always appear comfortable and content, never anxious or stressed. This is about safe, positive car travel.

5. **UK Details:** Where car exteriors are visible, try to include British elements (UK number plates, right-hand drive visibility, British weather through windows).

7. Optimise file sizes (compress to 200-300KB for web)
8. Review blog with images before publishing
