**For Each Keyword:**

2. Check top 10 results
3. Can you create better content? (Y/N)

5. Identify gaps you can fill
6. Check domain authority of competitors

**Competition Levels:**

### Step 4: Select Target Keywords

**Criteria:**
- Relevant to HappyPawsCo products/services

```
Dog Keywords (4):

- "reactive dog walking equipment" (low)
- "puppy carrier for small dogs" (medium)

Cat Keywords (4):
- "best cat carrier for vet visits uk" (medium)
- "indoor cat enrichment ideas" (low) ← Easy win!
- "cat litter box problems solutions" (low) ← Easy win!

## Common SEO Mistakes to Avoid

### ⚠️ Dog Keyword Tunnel Vision
**Problem:** Only targeting competitive dog keywords
**Solution:** Balance with easier cat keywords
**Impact:** Missing traffic opportunities, slow ranking growth

### ⚠️ Keyword Stuffing
**Problem:** Forcing keyword 20 times in 500 words
**Solution:** Natural placement, 1-2% density
**Impact:** Google penalty, poor user experience

### ⚠️ Thin Content
**Problem:** 300-word blog posts
**Solution:** Comprehensive coverage (1,000+ words)
**Impact:** Won't rank, provides no value

### ⚠️ No Internal Links
**Problem:** Each blog is isolated
**Solution:** Link to 5-9 other pages (products, blogs, lead magnets)
**Impact:** Poor SEO, low session duration, fewer conversions

### ⚠️ Ignoring Image SEO
**Problem:** "IMG_1234.jpg" with no alt text
**Solution:** Keyword-rich file names + descriptive alt text
**Impact:** Missing image search traffic, poor accessibility

### ⚠️ Duplicate Content
**Problem:** Same content for dog + cat (just swapping words)
**Solution:** Unique content for each species
**Impact:** Google penalty, cannibalized rankings

### ⚠️ No Mobile Optimization
**Problem:** Desktop-only design
**Solution:** Responsive mobile-first design
**Impact:** Poor rankings (Google mobile-first indexing!), high bounce rate

## Advanced SEO Tactics

### Featured Snippet Optimization

**What are Featured Snippets?**

**How to Optimize:**
1. Target question-based keywords
2. Provide clear, concise answers
3. Use list/table format
4. Include answer in H2 or H3
5. Define terms clearly

**Example (Dog):**
```
H2: What is the safest dog car harness?
[Answer paragraph, 40-50 words, direct answer first]

The safest dog car harness is one that has been crash tested and certified. Look for harnesses approved by the Center for Pet Safety (CPS) or similar organizations. The [Brand Name] harness is our top recommendation for safety.
```

H2: How big should a cat carrier be?
[Answer paragraph, 40-50 words, direct answer first]

A cat carrier should be 1.5 times the length of your cat from nose to base of tail. Your cat should be able to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. For most cats, this means a carrier measuring 18-24 inches long.
