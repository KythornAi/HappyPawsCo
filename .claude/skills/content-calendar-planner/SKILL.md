# Content Calendar Planner Skill

## Purpose
Strategic content planning tool for HappyPawsCo that creates balanced, engaging content calendars across blogs, Pinterest, and product launches. **Ensures equal representation of dog AND cat content** to serve your entire audience and capture market opportunities.

## Current Status
**Version:** 2.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** January 13, 2026
**Changes**: Added 60/20/20 content ratio tracking, flexible dog/cat ratios, keyword research integration

---

## Core Principles

### 📊 60/20/20 Content Ratio (NEW!)
**CRITICAL:** Every content plan MUST balance three content types:

**60% Product-Focused**:
- Directly features 1-3 products from HappyPawsCo inventory
- Natural product integration (not salesy)
- Examples: "Best Dog Car Harnesses for UK Roads", "Cat Carrier Buying Guide"
- CAN overlap with seasonal content (e.g., "Winter Car Safety" = seasonal + product)

**20% Educational**:
- Pure education with light product mentions (if any)
- Builds authority and trust
- Examples: "Understanding Dog Body Language", "Cat Enrichment Science"
- Establishes expertise (E-E-A-T)

**20% Seasonal**:
- Timely, relevant to current season/events
- Examples: "Winter Dog Walking Safety", "Bonfire Night Pet Anxiety"
- Keeps content fresh and contextually appropriate
- CAN overlap with product-focused (flexible categorization!)

**Why This Matters:**
- Balances commercial intent with value-first content
- Supports diverse keyword strategies
- Maintains helpful-not-pushy brand voice
- Covers entire customer journey (awareness → consideration → purchase)

### 🐾 Pet Content Balance Rule (UPDATED!)
**Flexible ratio based on inventory and sales data**

**Current Target: 70% Dog / 30% Cat** (January 2026)
- More dog products in current inventory
- Will adjust if cat products sell well
- Will adjust if more cat products added

**Balance Tracking:**
- Count dog-focused content pieces
- Count cat-focused content pieces
- Flag imbalance warnings when ratio exceeds 80/20
- Suggest cat topics when dog content dominates beyond target
- Suggest dog topics when cat content dominates beyond target

**Target is DATA-DRIVEN:**
- Review quarterly based on product sales
- Adjust based on inventory changes
- If cat products perform well → increase cat content
- If cat products don't sell → maintain dog-heavy ratio

**Why Flexibility Matters:**
- Content should reflect actual inventory
- Don't force 50/50 if products aren't balanced 50/50
- Sales data drives content strategy (not arbitrary balance)

## Content Gap Analysis

### When Planning, Ask:

**Balance Questions:**
1. How many dog topics this month? How many cat topics?
2. What's the current ratio? (Aim: 45-55% range)
3. Which species has been neglected recently?
4. Are there trending cat topics we're missing?
5. Are there trending dog topics we're missing?

**Strategic Questions:**
1. What products are launching soon? (Dog or cat?)
2. What seasonal events are coming? (Which species?)
3. What Pinterest trends are emerging? (Both species?)
4. What search terms are popular? (Dog vs cat keywords?)
5. What lead magnets need promotion? (Which species?)

**Opportunity Questions:**
1. What cat content gap can we fill?
2. What underserved cat owner need can we address?
3. What dog content is saturated (avoid)?
4. What unique angle can we take?
5. How can we cross-promote between species?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ⚠️ Dog Content Bias
**Problem:** Naturally gravitating toward dog topics
**Solution:** Start every month with cat content first
**Check:** If last 3 posts were dog-focused → STOP → Plan cat content

### ⚠️ Ignoring Cat Market
**Problem:** "Not enough cat products/topics"
**Solution:** Cat market is LESS competitive = easier wins!
**Action:** Research underserved cat niches

### ⚠️ Algorithm Reinforcement
**Problem:** Pinterest shows more dog content → post more dog content → cycle repeats
**Solution:** Break the cycle with intentional cat content
**Action:** Schedule cat pins in advance, commit to posting

### ⚠️ Product Launch Clustering
**Problem:** Launching 3 dog products in a row
**Solution:** Alternate species in product calendar
**Action:** If dog product launching → plan cat content around it

---

## Pinterest Strategy (Balanced)

### Pinning Schedule

**Daily Pins:** 3-5 pins total
- Mix dog and cat content
- Don't post 5 dog pins one day, 5 cat pins the next
- Aim for variety each day

**Weekly Target:** 21-35 pins
- ~10-15 dog-focused
- ~10-15 cat-focused
- ~0-5 universal/both

**Monthly Target:** 90-150 pins
- ~40-65 dog-focused
- ~40-65 cat-focused
- ~10-20 universal

### Pin Timing Strategy

**Best Times (UK-focused):**
- Morning: 8-10 AM (pet parents starting day)
- Lunchtime: 12-2 PM (browsing break)
- Evening: 7-9 PM (winding down, planning purchases)

**Species Distribution:**
- Morning: Mix of both
- Lunchtime: Alternate daily (dog Monday, cat Tuesday, etc.)
- Evening: Mix of both

## NEW: How to Use for Content Banking Sprint

### Step 1: Receive Keyword Research
**Input**: List of 50-100 blog topics from Keyword Research Agent

**What you'll see**:
- Topic title
- Primary keyword
- Competition level
- Search intent
- Product tie-in (1-3 products)
- Seasonality

### Step 2: Categorize by 60/20/20 Ratio

**Sort topics into buckets**:

**Product-Focused (60%)** = 30 topics (if planning 50 total):
- Must feature 1-3 products naturally
- Examples: "Best Dog Harnesses for UK Cars", "Lick Mat Benefits"
- Check: Does topic naturally lead to product mention?

**Educational (20%)** = 10 topics:
- Pure value, light product mentions
- Examples: "Dog Body Language Guide", "Cat Stress Signals"
- Check: Can stand alone without products?

**Seasonal (20%)** = 10 topics:
- Timely to season/event
- Examples: "Winter Car Safety", "Bonfire Night Anxiety"
- Check: Is this time-sensitive?
- Note: CAN overlap with product-focused!

### Step 3: Balance Dog/Cat Content

**Current Target: 70% Dog / 30% Cat**

If planning 50 blogs:
- 35 dog-focused topics
- 15 cat-focused topics

**Check each topic**:
- Is it dog-specific, cat-specific, or universal?
- Does product tie-in work for both species?
- Can universal topic be split into dog + cat versions?

### Step 4: Distribute Across Timeline

**For 50-100 blog banking sprint** (next 6-12 weeks):

**Week 1-2**: Front-load evergreen topics
**Week 3-4**: Mix in seasonal content for next 3 months
**Week 5-6**: Product-heavy topics (60% allocation)
**Week 7-8**: Educational + remaining seasonal

**Ensure**:
- Not all car safety topics in Week 1
- Product rotation (don't feature same product 3 blogs in a row)
- Seasonal topics scheduled appropriate to timing

### Step 5: Validate with Product Database

**Before finalizing calendar**:
- Query Product Database Agent for each product mentioned
- Confirm product is ACTIVE (not discontinued)
- Check Blog Usage Notes for positioning guidance
- Flag if product research is thin (Research Gap Filler needed)

### Step 6: Output to Google Sheet

**Format for Make.com automation**:

| Topic Title | Primary Keyword | Content Type | Species | Products (1-3) | Seasonality | Priority |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|---------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| [Title] | [keyword] | Product/Educational/Seasonal | Dog/Cat/Both | [Product URLs] | Evergreen/Winter/etc | High/Med/Low |
