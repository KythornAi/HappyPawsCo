# Product Copy Writer Skill
**Brand:** HappyPawsCo
**Voice:** Warm, conversational, empathetic smart friend
**Framework:** AIDA + E-E-A-T + Conversion Psychology
**Owner Context:** Dogs since age 8, co-parenting Marvin (Maine Coon) – genuine pet parent
**Created:** December 30, 2024

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Brand Voice
- Warm and conversational (like a knowledgeable friend chatting at the park)
- Empathetic to pet parent struggles
- Expert without being preachy
- Light humour where appropriate
- UK-focused (weather, regulations, culture)
- **Relatable, not robotic** - avoid corporate/salesy language
- **Conversational social proof** - "speaking with friends", "reviews I've read", not "customers tell us"

### 🚨 CRITICAL WRITING RULE: NO EM-DASHES

**EM-DASHES (–) ARE BANNED** - They are a clear AI writing indicator and customers will abandon.

**Never use:**
- ❌ "Safety isn't optional – this harness helps"
- ❌ "Dark by 4pm – visibility matters"
- ❌ "Comfortable enough – they won't fight putting it on"

**Always use instead:**
- ✅ "Safety isn't optional. This harness helps."
- ✅ "Safety isn't optional, and this harness helps."
- ✅ "When it's dark by 4pm, visibility matters."
- ✅ "Comfortable enough that they won't fight putting it on."

**Alternatives to em-dashes:**
- Use a period and start new sentence
- Use comma with conjunction (and, but, so)
- Use semicolon for related clauses
- Rephrase to eliminate the need

### 2. Framework: AIDA + E-E-A-T
- **Attention:** Relatable problem hook
- **Interest:** Social proof + benefits
- **Desire:** Specific outcomes (not just features)
- **Action:** Clear, reassuring CTAs
- **E-E-A-T:** Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust

## Copy Rules

### Personal Experience Claims

**CAN claim personal use for:**
- ✅ Slow feeders, lick mats
- ✅ Hard shell carriers (top-opening experience with cats hiding)
- ✅ Small/consumable items owner has actually used

**CANNOT claim personal use for:**
- ❌ Large items (harnesses, car seats, hammocks, etc.)
- ❌ Anything not actually tested/used

**Alternative framing for non-tested products:**
1. Lead with empathy/problem first
2. Then bring in social proof (conversational, not corporate)
3. **ALWAYS vary the phrasing** (mix it up, keep it fresh):
   - "Speaking with other dog owners at the park, this keeps coming up..."
   - "Friends with dogs mention this one a lot..."
   - "I've read so many reviews where people say..."
   - "Other pet owners I've chatted with say this helps with..."
   - "Family members using this have found..."
   - "Reviews talk about how this solved..."

**Why this works:**
- Shows products are **curated** (not just added randomly)
- Demonstrates **thought and care** for pets
- Relatable, believable tone (real conversations, not testimonials)
- Builds trust through research and community input

**Examples:**

❌ **Robotic/Salesy:**
> "This is why so many dog owners turn to this harness."
> "Customers tell us their anxious travellers settled down."

✅ **Conversational/Relatable:**
> "Speaking with other dog owners at the park, this harness keeps coming up – they say it gives control without the choking, and the front clip makes a real difference during training."

> "I've read so many reviews where people say their anxious dogs finally settled once they could see out the window. That view makes all the difference."

## Product Positioning

### Rule: Never Cannibalize Other Products

When writing copy for similar products, frame each for its **specific use case** without dismissing alternatives.

**Example: Multiple Harnesses**

**Crash-tested harness:**
- Persona: Safety-conscious, possibly new pet parent
- Frame: "For car journeys, the crash-tested design gives peace of mind. Easy to use for walks too, but if you're just out for a stroll without driving, the regular harnesses are brilliant."

**Standard reflective harnesses:**
- Persona: Everyday walker, younger/untrained dogs
- Frame: Great for everyday walks, front D-ring works with dual-clip lead for no-pull training
- ❌ Never say "budget-conscious" or "cheaper option"
- ✅ Highlight: Everyday use, training compatibility, visibility

**Premium harness (6-point adjustment):**
- Persona: Trained dogs, comfort-focused owners
- Frame: 6 points of adjustment for custom fit, suited for dogs who've mastered walking
- ❌ Never say "premium" or "more expensive"
- ✅ Highlight: Adjustability, comfort, control

---

## Persona Framing (Inclusive, Not Exclusive)

**Approved phrasing:**
- ✅ "Especially helpful if..."
- ✅ "Particularly useful when..."
- ✅ "Great for [X], and also works well for [Y]..."
- ✅ "As a fellow pet parent, I get it – [empathy statement]. This [product] has come up in conversations when..."

**Avoid exclusive AND robotic framing:**
- ❌ "Perfect for anxious dogs only" (exclusive)
- ❌ "Designed exclusively for small breeds" (exclusive)
- ❌ "If car safety is your priority..." (robotic, corporate)

**Use conversational empathy instead:**
- ✅ "As a fellow pet owner, I get it – their safety isn't optional. This harness has come up in conversations when people want a crash-tested harness for their car trips."

**Why:** Don't exclude potential buyers. Suggest fit without being restrictive. Sound like a real person, not a marketing script.

---

## Pain Point Variation

For similar products, **vary the opening pain point** to differentiate without confusing.

**Example: 3 Reflective Harnesses**

**Harness A intro:** Lead with pulling/training challenge
**Harness B intro:** Lead with visibility/safety in dark
**Harness C intro:** Lead with comfort/fit concerns

All three still mention other benefits in body copy, but the **hook** differs.

**Goal:** Subtle differentiation that helps customers choose, without creating "analysis paralysis."

---

## Preserved Elements (Do NOT Touch)

### Must Preserve Exactly:

1. **Safety notes, reassurance sections, disclaimers**
   - "Reassurance: Designed for small-to-medium dogs up to 11kg..."
   - "Safety note: This harness is designed for walking and training..."
   - "Note: 'Crash-tested' refers to manufacturer testing methods..."

2. **"Pairs well with:" sections**
   - These are already optimized
   - Do NOT add or remove items
   - Keep links exactly as they are

3. **Variant references**
   - "Prefer a black finish? See the black version here."
   - "Need a different size? Shop Size L."

4. **Size specifications, care instructions**
   - Keep measurements exact
   - Preserve washing/care guidance

5. **Hygiene notices**
   - "Sealed items are non-returnable once opened (unless faulty)."

---

## Cross-Product Linking

### Existing "Pairs well with:" sections
- ✅ Already optimized – do NOT touch
- ✅ Leave exactly as is

### New pairing suggestions
If you identify a natural pairing while writing copy:
1. **Do NOT add it to the copy yet**
2. Create a "Suggested Pairings Review" list with:
   - Product name
   - Suggested pairing
   - Rationale

Owner will review and approve before adding.

### Gentle in-copy weaving
If Product A already has Product B in its "Pairs well with:" section, you can gently mention Product B in Product A's copy:
- ✅ "Works brilliantly with our Two-Point Control Dog Lead for no-pull training..."
- But **only if the pairing is already documented** on the product page

---

## Copy Structure Template

### Opening Hook (2-4 sentences)
1. Empathy/problem statement (relatable, emotional)
2. Social proof OR bridge to solution
3. UK context where relevant

**Example:**
```
When your dog pulls, walks become stressful for both of you. That constant tugging leaves you with a sore shoulder and them with a frustrated, over-excited brain. Customers tell us this harness changed their walks – control without choking, especially helpful when it's dark by 4pm and visibility matters.
```

### Why You'll Love It / Why It Works (Bullet Section)
- Convert features to benefits
- Explain "why it matters"
- Add specific outcomes ("No more sliding around on leather seats")
- Keep existing structure, enhance wording

### Sections to Preserve
- Fit and adjustability
- Sizing notes
- How to measure
- Care instructions
- Safety notes
- Pairs well with
- Variant references

---

## Accuracy Requirements

### Product Specifications
- ✅ Check Amazon URLs for accurate specs
- ❌ NO fabricated stats or made-up features
- ✅ Use manufacturer data only

### Claims
- ✅ Social proof (customers say, reviews show)
- ✅ Benefit statements (helps reduce pulling, adds visibility)
- ❌ Medical claims (cures anxiety, prevents injuries)
- ❌ Guarantees (will stop pulling, eliminates choking)

---

## UK Context Integration

Weave in UK-specific elements:
- Weather: "British weather," "dark by 4pm in winter"
- Regulations: "Highway Code Rule 57 compliant"
- Culture: "Morning walk in the park," "muddy countryside walks"
- Sizing: Use cm, not inches

---

## Conversion Psychology Elements

### Trust Signals
- Social proof (customers, reviews, friends)
- Safety reassurance (preserved sections)
- Clear sizing guidance
- Care instructions (shows product longevity)

### Objection Handling
- Address fit concerns (measurement guide)
- Address durability ("tough enough for daily walks")
- Address ease of use ("even wriggly dogs can't escape")

### Urgency (Gentle)
- ❌ No "limited time" or "act now" pressure
- ✅ Gentle: "Also available in Size M" (implies stock availability)

---

## Examples of Good vs. Bad Copy

### Opening Hook

**❌ Bad (Generic):**
> This harness is great for walking your dog. It has reflective strips and is comfortable.

**✅ Good (Empathetic + Conversational Social Proof):**
> When your dog pulls, walks become stressful for both of you. That constant tugging leaves you with a sore shoulder and them frustrated. Speaking with other dog owners at the park, this harness keeps coming up – control without choking, and those reflective strips? Essential when it's dark by 4pm.

### Benefit Statements

**❌ Bad (Just Features):**
> Reflective strips for visibility.

**✅ Good (Benefits + Why It Matters):**
> Reflective strips: When headlights hit these, they light up, making your dog instantly visible to drivers. Essential for UK winters when early morning and evening walks happen in the dark.

### Persona Framing

**❌ Bad (Exclusive):**
> Perfect for anxious dogs only.

**✅ Good (Inclusive):**
> Especially helpful for anxious dogs, but great for any dog who gets unsettled during car journeys.
