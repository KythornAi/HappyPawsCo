**Email 3: Social Proof & Story (Day 5)**
```
SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS:
A) Why we started HappyPawsCo...
B) The real reason behind our pet travel gear
C) A quick story (and a favour to ask)

---

Hi [First name],

I wanted to share why HappyPawsCo exists.

It started with a stressful car journey. [Brief authentic story about pet travel challenge]. That feeling of "there must be a better way" stuck with me.

So we spent months testing, reading reviews, and talking to other pet parents to find gear that actually works. Not just looks good on a website, but works when your dog is anxious, your cat is hiding, or you're running late for the vet.

Every product on our site is there because it solved a real problem for real pets.

**Now a small favour?**

We're a small team, and your feedback means everything. If you've ordered from us, we'd love to hear what you think. Just reply to this email or leave a quick review.

And if you're still browsing? No pressure. Your 10% off [CODE] isn't going anywhere.

Cheers,
[Name]

P.S. Got a photo of your pet with their new gear? Send it over! We might feature them (with your permission, of course).

**Email 4: Helpful Tips (Day 7)**
```
SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS:
A) 3 things I wish I'd known about pet travel
B) Quick tips from our community
C) Your pet travel cheat sheet

---

Hi [First name],

Quick tips from our community of pet parents:

**1. The car test**
Before a long journey, do a 5-minute practice trip. Some pets need time to adjust, and it's better to discover that before the motorway.

**2. The harness check**
If you can fit more than two fingers under the harness, it's too loose. Sounds obvious, but it catches people out.

**3. The visibility rule**
If you can't see your dog from 100m away in low light, neither can drivers. Reflective gear isn't optional in UK winters.

Want more? Our blog has loads of practical guides: [BLOG LINK]

## Email Psychology Principles

### Subject Line Formula
- **Curiosity + Benefit:** "The 3-second check that prevents car disasters"
- **Question:** "Is your dog actually visible at 4pm?"
- **Personal:** "[First name], your basket is waiting"
- **Urgency (gentle):** "Your code expires tomorrow"

### Email Structure
1. **Opening:** Personal, warm, direct
2. **Value:** Tip, story, or helpful content
3. **Offer:** Product or action (soft, not pushy)
4. **Close:** Friendly sign-off
5. **P.S.:** Highest-converting real estate. Use it!

### Conversion Psychology
- **Reciprocity:** Give value first (tips, guides, discounts)
- **Social proof:** "Other pet parents say..."
- **Scarcity:** "Code expires in X days" (honest, not fake)
- **Authority:** Position as expert without being preachy
- **Liking:** Be warm, use humour, be human

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Hard sell in every email
- ❌ ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation!!!
- ❌ Fake urgency ("LAST CHANCE EVER!!!")
- ❌ Generic greetings ("Dear Valued Customer")
- ❌ Walls of text
- ❌ Multiple CTAs competing for attention
- ❌ Em-dashes (AI indicator)
- ❌ American spelling
