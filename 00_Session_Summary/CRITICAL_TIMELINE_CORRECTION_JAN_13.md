# 🚨 CRITICAL TIMELINE CORRECTION - January 13, 2026

**Created**: January 13, 2026 at 87% context
**Reason**: Major timeline misunderstanding discovered and corrected

---

## ⚠️ THE CORRECTION

### What Was Wrong
Multiple session documents referenced a "**49-day sprint**" as the time until launch.

### What Is Actually True
- **LAUNCH DATE**: January 30, 2026
- **TODAY**: January 13, 2026
- **DAYS UNTIL LAUNCH**: **17 DAYS** 🚨

### Where The Confusion Came From
- **Vertex AI Free Trial**: Day 41 of 90 = 49 days remaining
- **The Mix-Up**: Confused "49 days of free Vertex AI images" with "49 days until launch"

---

## 📊 REVISED CONTENT BANKING STRATEGY

### OLD Plan (WRONG)
- 49 days to generate 50-100 blogs
- ~10-15 blogs per week
- Leisurely pace with testing and refinement

### NEW Plan (CORRECT - 17 DAYS!)
- **Week 1 (Jan 13-19)**: Build Pinterest Pin Strategist, run Keyword Research, generate 10 blogs
- **Week 2 (Jan 20-26)**: Bank 10-15 more blogs (total: 20-25)
- **Week 3 (Jan 27-30)**: Final 5 blogs + launch prep (total: 25-30)
- **Target**: 20-30 blogs banked before launch (down from 50-100)

### Why 20-30 Blogs Is Still Good
- 2 blogs/week post-launch = 10-15 weeks of content (2.5-3.5 months)
- Still maximizes Vertex AI free period (have 49 days of free images)
- Post-launch can continue generating 2 new blogs/week with free images
- Front-loads launch preparation without overwhelming workload
