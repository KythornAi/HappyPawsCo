## 🚨 INCOMPLETE / NOT YET STARTED

### HIGH PRIORITY - Need These for 49-Day Sprint

**1. Pinterest Pin Strategist Agent** ⚠️ CRITICAL MISSING PIECE
- **Status**: Discussed but NOT built
- **Why**: Need 3 pin strategies per blog (different hooks) for Pinterest automation
- **Details**:
  - Reads 50 blog topics from Content Calendar
  - Designs 3 pins per topic (problem/solution, educational, seasonal angles)
  - Writes pin titles (50 chars) and descriptions (500 chars)
  - Suggests visual styles for Canva text overlay
  - Outputs to Pinterest Workflow Sheet
- **Referenced in**: SESSION_HANDOVER_JAN_13_CONTINUED.md lines 235-263
- **Impact**: Without this, Pinterest automation incomplete (only generates images, not strategy)
- **Action**: Build in next session BEFORE running Keyword Research Agent

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Important But Not Blocking Sprint

**2. Knowledge Base Q&A Session** ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
- **Status**: Mentioned during knowledge base creation, never completed
- **Why**: Fill gaps in brand understanding for agents/skills
- **What's Missing**:
  - Customer personas (who are we selling to?)
  - Detailed customer pain points
  - Product positioning strategy per customer segment
  - Brand values (beyond voice/tone)
  - Working processes (update HOW_WE_WORK_TOGETHER.md with carpel tunnel note, 49-day sprint context)
- **Files Affected**:
  - `HOW_WE_WORK_TOGETHER.md` - Has user profile but missing recent context (carpel tunnel, 49-day sprint urgency)
  - `HAPPYPAWSCO_BRAND_VOICE.md` - Has brand voice but missing customer personas
  - **NEW FILE NEEDED**: `CUSTOMER_PERSONAS.md` - Who buys from HappyPawsCo?
- **Impact**: Agents write better content when they understand target audience deeply
- **Action**: Q&A session to fill gaps (can do now at 82% context OR save for dedicated session)
- **User Quote**: "we will also have to analyse who our customer(s) are so we keep them in mind with our product positioning"

## 📋 MENTIONED BUT NOT COMMITTED TO

### Possible Future Enhancements (No Commitment Made)

**Brave Search MCP**
- **Status**: Mentioned as optional enhancement (not necessary)
- **Source**: SESSION_SUMMARY_JAN_13_FINAL.md line 227
- **Quote**: "Brave Search MCP: Mentioned as optional enhancement (not necessary), would give more search parameter control"
- **Decision**: WebSearch is sufficient, Brave not needed

**Gemini/Perplexity Integration**
- **Status**: Kyle has paid access, can manually run prompts
- **Source**: SESSION_HANDOVER_JAN_13_CONTINUED.md
- **Decision**: Not building formal integration, Kyle runs manually and saves results to folder for agents to read

**Additional Blog Structure Updates**
- **Status**: Mentioned in Jan 12 handover re: AEO/GEO optimization
- **Source**: SESSION_HANDOVER_JAN_12_2026.md
- **Decision**: Already addressed in Research Gap Filler Agent (searches for 2024-2026 AEO/GEO best practices)
