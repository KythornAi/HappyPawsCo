## WORKING WITH COMET (Cursor AI)

**IMPORTANT:** User works with Comet (Cursor AI assistant) who gets overwhelmed easily.

**Rules when creating prompts for Comet:**
- Break everything into SMALL, manageable steps (1-3 sentences max per step)
- ONE task at a time
- Wait for confirmation before next step
- Never give massive multi-step instructions in one go
- Use simple, clear language

**Example of what NOT to do:**
- Giving Comet all 9 trust badge setup steps at once

**Example of what TO do:**
- Give Comet Step 1, wait for "done", then Step 2, wait for "done", etc.

**Reference:** `COMET_PROMPTS_STEP_BY_STEP.md` - Perfect example of how to structure prompts for Comet

2. **Communication:** Direct, efficient, no fluff
3. **Organization:** LOVES clean, organized files (hates messy folders with 40 versions)

---

## IF USER MENTIONS THESE ISSUES

### "Comet is struggling with trust badges"
- Check `COMET_PROMPTS_STEP_BY_STEP.md`
- Ask what error/issue Comet is showing
- Troubleshoot step-by-step (don't give him everything at once)
- May need to simplify or use alternative approach

### "CSS jitter is back"
- Check `CSS_HEADER_JITTER_FIX.md`
- May need to create stronger/alternative fix
- Ask: Is it the same behavior or different?

### "I want to work on MCP/Skills"
- Check `08_MCP_Future_Development/MCP_SKILLS_CONVERSATION_LOG.md`
- Acknowledge this needs 1-2 hour focused session
- Don't rush it - respect user wants to do it properly
- Ask if now is the right time (after store launch is better)

### "Brain dump time"
- Listen and take notes
- Create organized document with priorities
- Help user stay on track and not lose focus

### "Folders are messy again"
- Reference `CLEANUP_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` for approach
- Do file audit → delete/archive → organize
- Keep "one strong doc instead of 40 versions" principle

2. **Comet needs baby steps** - Never overwhelm him with long instructions
3. **File hygiene matters** - Keep folders clean, one strong doc > 40 versions
4. **Don't rush MCP/Skills** - User wants to do it properly when time allows
5. **Store launch is soon** - Time-sensitive work, prioritize launch-critical items
6. **User is organized** - Loves structure, documentation, and clear next steps

---

## QUOTE OF THE SESSION

**User:** "i think from time to time we need to do some house keeping to keep the files relevant and ensure we are not having to go through tons of versions of or corrected or updated copies, once a new doc is created and it has all the important details then get rid of all the ones leading up to it, so there is one or a few strong docs when we need to go back to than 40 some good some bad and some ugly lol"

**Translation:** Keep it clean, organized, and useful. Quality over quantity.
