Returns &amp; Refunds Policy
30-Day “Happy Tails” Returns (Goodwill Policy)

We offer a 30-day return window from delivery for unused items returned in resaleable condition (see “Return Condition” below). This is in addition to your legal rights.

Your Legal Right to Cancel (Online Orders)

If you are a UK consumer buying online, you may have the right to cancel within 14 days of receiving your order, then a further 14 days to send it back. Some exceptions apply (see “Non-Returnable Items” below). This policy does not affect your statutory rights.

Return Condition (Important for Pet Products)

To be eligible for a return (including our 30-day goodwill returns), items must be returned unused, unwashed, and in resaleable condition, in original packaging, with tags attached where applicable.

Items must be free from pet hair, dirt, stains, strong odours, and signs of wear.
Please try on coats and harnesses indoors and ensure your pet is clean before sizing.
We recommend taking a quick photo before returning, especially for higher-value items.

If an item is returned in a condition that suggests use beyond what is needed to assess fit or basic function, we may reduce the refund to reflect any loss in value. If the item cannot be resold, we may refuse the return.

Non-Returnable Items

The following are not returnable for change-of-mind returns:

Perishable goods (for example, treats).
Gift cards.
Personalised items.
Hygiene-sensitive sealed or boxed items once opened or unsealed (for example wipes, grooming items, and boxed multipacks such as poo bags), unless faulty or incorrect.
Refunds (Change of Mind)

We offer refunds only (no direct exchanges) for change-of-mind returns. If you’d like a different size or colour, return your item for a refund and place a new order.

Once your return is received and inspected, refunds are issued to the original payment method.

Faulty, Damaged, or Wrong Item

If your order arrives faulty or damaged, or we sent the wrong item, contact us as soon as possible and we will make it right with a replacement or refund, depending on the situation. We may ask for a photo to help us resolve it quickly.

Return Shipping Costs
Change of mind: customers are responsible for return shipping costs.
Faulty, damaged, or wrong item: we will cover return shipping (or provide an appropriate solution).
