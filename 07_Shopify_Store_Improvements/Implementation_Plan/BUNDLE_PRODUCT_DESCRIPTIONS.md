**What's Included:**

### Product Description

**Headline:**
```
Everything You Need for Safe, Stress-Free Car Journeys with Your Dog
```

**Introduction:**
```
If you're tired of your dog sliding around the back seat, climbing into the footwell, or getting anxious during car trips, this bundle solves all of it. We've put together the three essentials for keeping small-to-medium dogs safe, comfortable, and secure in the car—without the guesswork.
```

**What's Included & Why It Works:**

```
**1. Kurgo Tru-Fit Crash-Tested Car Harness (Medium)**

This isn't just any harness. It's crash-tested to the same standard as child car seats (FMVSS 213), which means it's designed to actually protect your dog in an accident—not just tick a box. Five adjustment points mean you get a proper fit, and it doubles as a walking harness when you arrive at your destination.

- Crash-tested to FMVSS 213 standard
- 5-point adjustment for secure fit
- Doubles as a walking harness
- Suitable for dogs 11-23kg


**2. Elevated View Dog Booster Seat (Grey, Medium)**

Small dogs love being able to see out the window. This elevated booster seat gives them the view (and the comfort) they deserve, while keeping them safely contained and secure. No more scrambling around the back seat or trying to climb onto your lap while you're driving. It clips to the seat belt and includes a tether that attaches to the harness.

- Elevates small dogs to window level
- Secure seat belt attachment
- Includes safety tether for harness
- Removable, washable cushion
- Suitable for dogs up to 11kg


**3. ISOFIX/LATCH Swivel Seat-Belt Tether**

This tether clips into your car's ISOFIX anchor points (the same ones used for child car seats) for maximum security. The 360-degree swivel prevents tangling, so your dog can move around comfortably without getting twisted up. It's the strongest, most secure way to attach a harness in the car.

- Uses ISOFIX anchor points for maximum strength
- 360-degree swivel prevents tangling
- Universal fit with all car harnesses
- Heavy-duty metal clips and reinforced webbing
```

**Why This Bundle Works:**

```
This isn't a random collection of products. It's a complete car safety system designed to work together:

- The **crash-tested harness** protects your dog in an accident
- The **booster seat** keeps small dogs elevated, comfortable, and secure
- The **ISOFIX tether** anchors everything to the strongest point in your car

Together, they give you peace of mind that your dog is safe, comfortable, and not distracting you while you drive.
```

**Who It's For:**

```
Perfect for:
- Small-to-medium dog owners (dogs up to 23kg)
- New puppy parents setting up car travel for the first time
- Anyone who's had a scary moment with their dog loose in the car
- Dog owners who want crash-tested safety, not just a "looks safe" harness
```

**The Savings:**

```
**Bundle Price:** £XX.XX
**Individual Price:** £XX.XX
**You Save:** £XX.XX (XX% off)

That's proper savings on products you'd buy anyway—without compromising on safety.
```

**What You'll Notice Immediately:**

```
- Your dog stays put instead of roaming around the car
- No more anxiety about sudden stops or sharp turns
- Small dogs can see out the window (much calmer)
- You can focus on driving, not wrangling your dog
- Peace of mind knowing they're actually protected
```

**Care & Safety:**

```
**Installation:**
- Harness: Adjust to fit snugly (you should be able to fit two fingers under straps)
- Booster seat: Secure with seat belt straps and headrest clips
- ISOFIX tether: Clip into ISOFIX anchor points (check your car manual for location)

**Cleaning:**
- Harness: Spot clean or hand wash, air dry
- Booster seat: Remove cushion and machine wash on gentle cycle
- Tether: Wipe clean with damp cloth

**Safety Tips:**
- Never leave your dog unattended in the car
- Always attach the tether to a harness, not a collar (prevents choking)
- Check all clips and straps before each journey
- The booster seat is for small dogs up to 11kg only (larger dogs should use the harness + tether without the seat)
```

**Sizing Guide:**

```
**Harness (Medium):**
- Neck: 40-63cm
- Chest: 46-71cm
- Weight: 11-23kg
- Measure at the base of neck and widest part of chest

**Booster Seat (Medium):**
- Suitable for dogs up to 11kg
- Seat dimensions: 40×30×25cm
- Measure your dog sitting down

**ISOFIX Tether:**
- Universal fit (works with all cars that have ISOFIX anchor points)
- Check your car manual to locate anchor points
```

**Frequently Asked Questions:**

```
**Q: Will this fit my car?**
A: The ISOFIX tether fits any car with ISOFIX anchor points (most UK cars made after 2006). Check your car manual or look for the ISOFIX symbol between the seat cushions. The booster seat and harness fit all standard cars and SUVs.

**Q: Can I use the harness for walking as well?**
A: Yes! The Kurgo harness has both a front clip (for no-pull training) and a back clip (for regular walking). It's designed to work as both a car harness and a walking harness.

**Q: My dog is nervous in the car. Will this help?**
A: The elevated booster seat often helps anxious dogs because they can see out the window instead of being stuck down in the footwell. The secure harness also prevents them from sliding around, which can make them feel safer.

**Q: Is this really crash-tested?**
A: Yes. The Kurgo Tru-Fit harness is crash-tested to FMVSS 213, the same standard used for child car seats. That's rare in the dog harness world and means it's been designed to actually protect your dog in a crash.

**Q: What if my dog is bigger than 11kg?**
A: Use the harness and ISOFIX tether without the booster seat. The booster seat is only suitable for dogs up to 11kg, but the harness works for dogs 11-23kg.

**Q: Can I return it if it doesn't fit?**
A: Yes. We offer a 30-day return policy. If the harness doesn't fit or you're not happy with the bundle, you can return it for a full refund.
```

**What's Not Included (But You Might Want):**

```
- **Flatbed Back-Seat Extender:** If your dog prefers to lie down flat during car journeys, consider adding this to create a flat surface across the back seat and footwell.

- **Car Seat Hammock:** Protects your car seats from mud, hair, and scratches. Works perfectly with the harness and tether.

## Bundle 2: Walking Essentials for Pullers

**Bundle Name:** No-Pull Walking Bundle

**What's Included:**
- Rabbitgoo Reflective No-Pull Dog Harness (Medium or Large)
- Two-Point Control Dog Lead (Black or Brown)
- Earth Rated Dog Poo Bags (270 Count, Unscented)

**Bundle Price:** £XX.XX (Save £XX vs. buying separately)

---

### Product Description

**Headline:**
```
Everything You Need to Stop the Pulling and Enjoy Your Walks Again
```

**Introduction:**
```
If your dog drags you down the street every morning, you're not alone. And no, it's not because you're a bad dog owner—it's because most harnesses and leads aren't designed to actually help with pulling. This bundle is. It's the exact setup that works for thousands of frustrated dog owners who just want to walk their dog without dislocating a shoulder.
```

**What's Included & Why It Works:**

```
**1. Rabbitgoo Reflective No-Pull Dog Harness (Medium or Large)**

This is the harness that finally clicks for most pullers. The front clip redirects your dog back towards you when they lunge forward, which interrupts the pulling behaviour without choking or hurting them. It's padded, adjustable, and has reflective strips for safer evening walks.

- Front clip stops pulling by redirecting your dog towards you
- Back clip for regular walking when they've calmed down
- Reflective strips for visibility in low light
- Padded mesh for comfort
- 4 adjustment points for a secure fit

**Medium:** Neck 38-58cm, Chest 43-66cm (small-to-medium dogs)
**Large:** Neck 46-66cm, Chest 43-85cm (medium-to-large dogs)


**2. Two-Point Control Dog Lead (Black or Brown)**

This is where the magic happens. Instead of a normal lead that clips to one point, this clips to both the front and back of the harness at the same time. That gives you steering (via the front clip) and stability (via the back clip) in one lead. It's like power steering for your dog.

You can also use it as a regular single-point lead, a short traffic lead, or even hands-free. Three leads in one.

- Dual-clip design for maximum control
- Use both clips for pullers, single clip for calm walking
- Converts to short traffic lead for busy streets
- 120cm total length
- Heavy-duty clips and reinforced stitching


**3. Earth Rated Dog Poo Bags (270 Count, Unscented)**

Let's be honest—you're going to need poo bags. These are thick, leak-proof, unscented, and come in recyclable packaging. 270 bags (18 rolls) means you won't run out every other week. Not glamorous, but essential.

- 270 bags (18 rolls) = 4-6 months' worth for most dogs
- Leak-proof and thick (no accidents)
- Unscented (no fake "lavender" smell)
- Fits standard lead dispensers
- Recyclable cardboard packaging
```

**Why This Bundle Works:**

```
The harness and lead are designed to work together as a system:

- The **front clip on the harness** stops pulling by turning your dog back towards you
- The **two-point lead** connects to both front and back, giving you steering + stability
- The result: Your dog can't build momentum to pull, and you have control without yanking

It's not magic—it's just physics. And it works.
```

**Who It's For:**

```
Perfect for:
- Dogs that pull on walks (especially young, strong, or excitable dogs)
- New dog owners struggling with lead training
- Anyone whose shoulder hurts after every walk
- Dogs that lunge at squirrels, other dogs, or passing cars
- Owners who want to enjoy their walks instead of dreading them
```

**The Savings:**

```
**Bundle Price:** £XX.XX
**Individual Price:** £XX.XX
**You Save:** £XX.XX (XX% off)

Everything you need to start fresh with walking, without buying things separately and hoping they work together.
```

**What You'll Notice Immediately:**

```
- Your dog can't pull as hard (front clip redirects them)
- You have more control without yanking or choking
- Walks feel less like a battle
- Your shoulder stops hurting
- Evening walks are safer (thanks to reflective strips)
- You're not running out of poo bags every week
```

**How to Use the Two-Point Lead:**

```
**For Pullers (Training Mode):**
1. Clip one end to the front D-ring on the harness
2. Clip the other end to the back D-ring
3. Hold the middle handle
4. When your dog pulls forward, the front clip redirects them back towards you

**For Calm Walking (Single Lead Mode):**
- Clip to the back D-ring only for regular walking once they've learned not to pull

**For Busy Streets (Traffic Mode):**
- Shorten the lead by clipping both ends to the back D-ring for close control near roads

**For Hands-Free (Optional):**
- Clip one end to your belt loop or waist and the other to the harness back clip
```

**Care & Safety:**

```
**Cleaning:**
- Harness: Spot clean or hand wash in warm soapy water, air dry
- Lead: Wipe clean with damp cloth or hand wash
- Poo bags: Store in a cool, dry place

**Safety Tips:**
- Never attach a lead to a collar for pulling dogs (risk of choking/trachea damage)
- Always use a harness for pullers
- Check clips and stitching before each walk
- Reflective strips work best when clean—wipe down if muddy
```

**Sizing Guide:**

```
**Rabbitgoo Harness - Medium:**
- Neck: 38-58cm
- Chest: 43-66cm
- Best for: Cocker Spaniels, Beagles, French Bulldogs, small Border Collies

**Rabbitgoo Harness - Large:**
- Neck: 46-66cm
- Chest: 43-85cm
- Best for: Labradors, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, large mixed breeds

**How to Measure:**
1. Neck: Measure at the base of the neck (where a collar sits)
2. Chest: Measure around the widest part of the chest (just behind the front legs)
3. Between sizes? Go up for comfort

**Two-Point Lead:**
- One size fits all (120cm total length)
- Works with any harness that has front and back D-rings

**Poo Bags:**
- Universal fit for all standard dispensers
```

**Frequently Asked Questions:**

```
**Q: Will this really stop my dog pulling?**
A: It won't stop it overnight (training takes time), but it will make it much harder for them to pull and much easier for you to redirect them. Most people notice a difference on the first walk.

**Q: My dog is really strong. Will this hold up?**
A: The lead is heavy-duty with reinforced stitching and metal clips rated for strong pullers. The harness distributes force across the chest, not the neck, so it's safer and more comfortable for strong dogs.

**Q: Can I use this for a puppy?**
A: Yes, as long as they fit the harness sizing. Starting with a no-pull harness early helps teach good walking habits from the beginning.

**Q: What if the harness doesn't fit?**
A: We offer a 30-day return policy. Measure your dog before ordering, and if it doesn't fit, you can return or exchange it.

**Q: Do I have to use both clips on the lead?**
A: Not once your dog has learned to walk nicely. Start with both clips (front and back) for training, then switch to just the back clip when they're calmer. It's a flexible system.

**Q: How long do 270 poo bags last?**
A: For most dogs (1-2 walks per day), about 4-6 months. That's 18 rolls, so you won't be running out constantly.
```

**What's Not Included (But You Might Want):**

```
- **Retractable Lead (5m or 10m):** For off-lead training in parks or open spaces where your dog can explore safely.

- **Pet Wipes:** Handy for cleaning muddy paws after walks before getting back in the car.

- **Treat Pouch:** Makes reward-based training easier during walks.

## Bundle 3: Puppy Starter Essentials

**Bundle Name:** New Puppy Essentials Bundle

**What's Included:**
- Rabbitgoo Reflective No-Pull Dog Harness (Medium)
- Slow Feeder Bowl (Green or Light Blue)
- Lick Mat for Dogs (Dark Red or Beige)
- Pet Wipes (Unscented, 100 Count)

**Bundle Price:** £XX.XX (Save £XX vs. buying separately)

---

### Product Description

**Headline:**
```
Everything New Puppy Parents Need to Start Off Right (Without the Overwhelm)
```

**Introduction:**
```
Getting a puppy is exciting. It's also overwhelming. There are about 47 things people will tell you that you "must" buy, and half of them you'll never use. This bundle is different. These are the four things that actually make life easier in the first few months—covering walks, feeding, anxiety, and cleanup. No fluff, just the essentials.
```

**What's Included & Why It Works:**

```
**1. Rabbitgoo Reflective No-Pull Dog Harness (Medium)**

Puppies pull. It's what they do. Starting with a harness (not a collar) protects their developing neck and trachea, and a front-clip harness teaches them not to pull from day one. This one's adjustable, so it grows with your puppy, and the reflective strips keep them visible on evening walks.

- Front clip for teaching loose-lead walking from the start
- Back clip for regular walks once they've got the hang of it
- 4 adjustment points to fit as they grow
- Reflective strips for safer evening walks
- Padded and breathable for comfort

**Size Medium:** Neck 38-58cm, Chest 43-66cm (most small-to-medium puppies from 4-6 months onwards)


**2. Slow Feeder Bowl (Green or Light Blue)**

Puppies inhale their food. This bowl forces them to slow down, which prevents choking, reduces bloating, and turns mealtime into a bit of mental stimulation. It's one of those small things that makes a big difference.

- Maze pattern slows eating speed by 10x
- Prevents choking and reduces bloat risk
- Turns mealtime into enrichment (mental stimulation)
- Non-slip base so it doesn't slide across the floor
- Dishwasher safe

**Suitable for:** Small-to-medium puppies and adult dogs


**3. Lick Mat for Dogs (Dark Red or Beige)**

This is your secret weapon for stressful situations. Spread peanut butter, yogurt, or wet food on the mat, stick it to the wall or floor, and your puppy will lick it calmly for 10-20 minutes. Use it for:

- Bath time (stick it to the bathroom tiles = distracted puppy)
- Nail trimming
- Crate training (calming activity)
- Vet visits (reduces anxiety)
- Fireworks or thunderstorms

It's one of the cheapest, most useful tools for anxious or overexcited puppies.

- Textured surface for slow licking (calming effect)
- Strong suction cups stick to tiles, glass, metal
- BPA-free, food-safe silicone
- Dishwasher safe
- 20cm diameter


**4. Pet Wipes (Unscented, 100 Count)**

Puppies get messy. Muddy paws, dirty faces, post-poo cleanup, drool, you name it. These wipes are hypoallergenic, unscented, and thick enough to actually work. Keep a pack by the door, in the car, and next to the puppy crate. You'll use them every single day.

- 100 wipes per pack (lasts about a month)
- Hypoallergenic (safe for sensitive puppy skin)
- Unscented (no weird fake lavender smell)
- Thick and durable (won't tear)
- Resealable pack keeps wipes moist
```

**Why This Bundle Works:**

```
Puppies need:
1. **Safe, comfortable gear for walks** → Harness
2. **Slower, healthier eating habits** → Slow feeder bowl
3. **Calming tools for stressful moments** → Lick mat
4. **Quick cleanup solutions** → Pet wipes

This bundle covers all four without buying a ton of stuff you won't use. It's the practical, "I wish someone had told me this" starter kit.
```

**Who It's For:**

```
Perfect for:
- First-time puppy parents
- New puppy arrivals (8 weeks to 6 months old)
- Anyone feeling overwhelmed by puppy gear advice
- Puppy owners who want quality essentials, not junk
- Gift for someone getting a new puppy
```

**The Savings:**

```
**Bundle Price:** £XX.XX
**Individual Price:** £XX.XX
**You Save:** £XX.XX (XX% off)

Get everything at once and save. No need to piece it together over multiple orders.
```

**What You'll Notice Immediately:**

```
- Walks are easier (harness prevents pulling from the start)
- Mealtime is calmer (puppy eats slower, no choking)
- Stressful moments are more manageable (lick mat = instant calm)
- Cleanup is faster (wipes on hand for every mess)
- You feel more prepared and less stressed
```

**How to Use Each Item:**

```
**Harness:**
1. Adjust all four straps to fit snugly (two fingers should fit under straps)

3. Switch to back clip once they walk calmly
4. Check fit weekly as your puppy grows

**Slow Feeder Bowl:**
1. Add puppy's regular food (dry, wet, or raw all work)
2. Let them figure out how to eat around the maze

**Lick Mat:**
1. Spread peanut butter, plain yogurt, or wet dog food on the mat
2. Stick to bathroom tiles, crate wall, or floor
3. Let puppy lick while you do the stressful thing (bath, nails, etc.)
4. Freeze it for extra-long distraction time
5. Rinse or dishwasher clean

1. Keep by the door for post-walk paw cleaning
2. Keep in the car for messy situations
3. Use on face, paws, bum, or coat as needed
4. Safe for daily use (hypoallergenic formula)

```

**Frequently Asked Questions:**

```
**Q: What age puppy is this suitable for?**
A: The harness fits most puppies from about 4-6 months onwards (depending on breed). The bowl, lick mat, and wipes are suitable from 8 weeks+. If your puppy is under 4 months and very small, they may need a smaller harness size.

**Q: My puppy is growing fast. Will the harness still fit?**
A: The Medium harness has 4 adjustment points, so it fits a range of sizes as your puppy grows. Most puppies will use it for 3-6 months before needing to size up.

**Q: Is the lick mat safe if my puppy chews it?**
A: It's made from food-grade silicone and is safe if small pieces are accidentally swallowed. That said, always supervise the first few uses. If your puppy tries to chew it instead of lick it, remove it and try again later.

**Q: What can I put on the lick mat?**
A: Peanut butter (xylitol-free), plain yogurt, mashed banana, wet dog food, or pureed pumpkin. Avoid anything toxic to dogs (chocolate, xylitol, grapes, onions).

**Q: Will the slow feeder bowl work with wet food?**
A: Yes! It works with dry kibble, wet food, and raw diets. Just wash it thoroughly after each use.

**Q: Can I return items if they don't work for my puppy?**
A: Yes, we offer a 30-day return policy on the bundle.
```

**A Note for First-Time Puppy Parents:**

```
You don't need everything on every "puppy checklist" you'll find online. You need:
- A safe harness for walks
- A way to slow down eating
- Tools to manage stress and anxiety
- Quick cleanup solutions

That's this bundle. Start here, keep it simple, and add things as you figure out what your specific puppy needs. You've got this.
