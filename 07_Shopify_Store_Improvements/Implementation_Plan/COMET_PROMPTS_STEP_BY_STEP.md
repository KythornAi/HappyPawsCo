## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

Give Comet ONE step at a time. Wait for him to complete each step before moving to the next.

## STEP 1: Setup Core Badge #1 (Free Delivery)

```
Hi Comet,

I need you to create a trust badge in Avada with these details:

Icon: Delivery truck
Headline: "Free UK Delivery Over £50"
Subtext: "Standard £3.99 • Express £7.99"

Show this badge on: All product pages
Position: Below the "Add to cart" button

Let me know when this is done.
```

**Wait for Comet to confirm. Then move to Step 2.**

---

## STEP 2: Setup Core Badge #2 (Returns)

```
Now add a second badge:

Icon: Return arrow
Headline: "30-Day Happy Tails Returns"
Subtext: "Unused items in resaleable condition"

Show this badge on: All product pages
Position: Below the "Add to cart" button (next to the Free Delivery badge)

Let me know when done.
```

**Wait for confirmation. Then Step 3.**

---

## STEP 3: Setup Core Badge #3 (Secure Checkout)

```
Add a third badge:

Icon: Padlock
Headline: "Secure Checkout"
Subtext: "Your payment info is encrypted"

Show this badge on: All product pages
Position: Below the "Add to cart" button (next to the other two badges)

Let me know when done.
```

**Wait for confirmation. Then Step 4.**

---

## STEP 4: Add Badges to Homepage

```
Now add these same 3 badges to the homepage:

Position: Below the hero section or below featured products

Make sure they display in a row (3 badges side by side on desktop, stacked on mobile).

Let me know when done.
```

**Wait for confirmation. Then Step 5.**

---

## STEP 5: Add Badges to Cart Page

```
Add these same 3 badges to the cart page:

Position: Above the "Proceed to Checkout" button

Let me know when done.
```

**Wait for confirmation. Then Step 6.**

---

## STEP 6: Test on Mobile and Desktop

```
Please check the following and send me screenshots:

1. Product page - do the badges show below Add to Cart?
2. Homepage - do the badges show?
3. Cart page - do the badges show?
4. Mobile - do the badges stack properly or look broken?

Send me screenshots of each.
```

**Wait for screenshots. Review them. If good, move to Step 7.**

---

## STEP 7: Add Product-Specific Badge (Crash-Tested) - OPTIONAL

```
Create a new badge for ONE specific product only:

Icon: Shield or checkmark
Headline: "Crash-Tested to FMVSS 213"
Subtext: "Independently tested for vehicle safety"

Show ONLY on this product: "Kurgo Enhanced Strength Tru-Fit Car Harness (Medium)"

Position: Near the product features list or below Add to Cart

Let me know when done.
```

**Wait for confirmation. Then Step 8.**

---

## STEP 8: Add Product-Specific Badge (Reflective) - OPTIONAL

```
Create a new badge:

Icon: Moon or visibility icon
Headline: "Reflective for Safer Walks"
Subtext: "High-visibility for low-light walks"

Show ONLY on these 3 products:
- Rabbitgoo Reflective No-Pull Dog Harness (Medium)
- Rabbitgoo Reflective No-Pull Dog Harness (Large)
- Reflective No-Pull Dog Harness (Padded, Escape-Resist, Metal Rings - Medium)

Position: Near the product features list or below Add to Cart

Let me know when done.
```

**Wait for confirmation. Then Step 9.**

---

## STEP 9: Add Product-Specific Badge (BPA-Free) - OPTIONAL

```
Create a new badge:

Icon: Checkmark
Headline: "BPA-Free & Food-Safe"
Subtext: "Safe materials for your pet"

Show ONLY on these 6 products:
- Lick Mat for Dogs (Dark Red)
- Slow Feeder Bowl (Green)
- Slow Feeder Bowl (Light Blue)
- Stainless Steel Pet Water Bottle – 800ml (Blue)
- Stainless Steel Pet Water Bottle – 800ml (Pink)
- Collapsible Travel Bowls (2-pack, Grey/Blue)

Position: Near the product features list or below Add to Cart

Let me know when done.
```

**Wait for confirmation. Done!**

## SIMPLIFIED VERSION (If Comet Struggles with Steps 7-9)

If Avada doesn't support product-specific badges or Comet is struggling, **SKIP Steps 7-9** and just do Steps 1-6.

The 3 core badges (Free Delivery, Returns, Secure Checkout) are the most important and will give you 80% of the conversion benefit.

---

## What to Do If Comet Says:

**"I can't find where to position the badges"**
→ Tell him: "Use Avada's settings to choose 'Below Add to Cart button' or 'Product page - custom position'"

**"The badges look weird on mobile"**
→ Tell him: "Change the mobile layout to 'stacked' or '2 per row' in Avada settings"

**"I can't make badges show only on specific products"**
→ Tell him: "That's fine, just do the 3 core badges on all products for now. We'll add product-specific ones later."

**"Avada is asking about display rules"**
→ Tell him: "Set display rules to 'All Products' for the 3 core badges"

**"Which icon should I use?"**
→ Tell him: "Choose the closest match from Avada's icon library - doesn't need to be perfect"

---

## Expected Time Per Step

- Steps 1-3: 5-10 minutes each (15-30 min total)
- Steps 4-5: 5 minutes each (10 min total)
- Step 6: 10 minutes (testing)
- Steps 7-9: 10 minutes each (30 min total) - OPTIONAL

**Total: 55-70 minutes if doing all steps, 25-40 minutes if just core badges**

---

## When It's Done

You should see:

**On product pages:**
```
[Add to cart button]

🚚 Free UK Delivery Over £50    ↩️ 30-Day Happy Tails Returns    🔒 Secure Checkout
```

**On Kurgo harness page (if you did Step 7):**
```
✓ Crash-Tested to FMVSS 213
```

---

**Status:** Ready to use with Comet
**Recommendation:** Start with Steps 1-6 only (core badges). Add product-specific badges later if Comet handles the first steps well.
