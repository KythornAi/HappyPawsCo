# Image Alt Text Optimization for All Products
**Purpose:** SEO-friendly, descriptive alt text for product images (max 8 images per product)
**Created:** December 30, 2024
**Status:** Ready to paste into Shopify

---

## Why Alt Text Matters

**SEO Benefits:**
- Google Images visibility
- Better search rankings for product keywords
- Accessibility for screen readers

**Best Practices:**
- Describe what's shown, not what you want to rank for
- Be specific but natural (no keyword stuffing)
- Include product name, color/size variant, and what's visible
- Keep it under 125 characters when possible

---

## How to Use This File

**For each product:**
1. Find your product in the list below
2. Match the image position (Image 1 = main product photo, Image 2 = lifestyle/in-use, etc.)
3. Copy the alt text
4. Paste into Shopify's image alt text field

**In Shopify:**
- Products → Select product → Scroll to images → Click image → Add alt text field
