## Usage Guidelines

**Tone:** Helpful, not pushy. Give them the info they need to make the right choice.

**Keep it short:** 1-2 sentences max. People scanning on mobile won't read paragraphs.

**Include:**
- ✅ Key measurements (neck, chest, weight, dimensions)
- ✅ What to do if between sizes
- ✅ Who it's suitable for (small, medium, large dogs)

**Don't include:**
- ❌ Salesy language ("This amazing product...")
- ❌ Unnecessary detail (save that for the description)
- ❌ Repeat info that's already in the main description

## Shopify Implementation

**Option 1: Add to product description**
Paste directly above "Add to Cart" button in product description editor.

**Option 2: Use metafields**
Create a "sizing_guidance" metafield and display it near the variant selector in your theme.

**Option 3: Use a sizing app**
Install a Shopify app like "Size Chart" or "Kiwi Sizing" to show sizing info in a popup or inline.

**Status:** Ready for your review
**Expected impact:** 15-30% reduction in sizing-related returns and "What size?" support emails
