## Product 1: Rabbitgoo Reflective No-Pull Dog Harness (Medium)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What size should I choose?**
Measure your dog's neck at the base (not where a collar sits) and chest at the widest part behind the front legs. Size M fits neck girth 38-58cm and chest girth 43-66cm. If measurements fall between sizes, go up a size for comfort. The four adjustment points let you fine-tune the fit.

**Will this stop my dog pulling completely?**
It helps, but no harness is magic. The front clip redirects their momentum sideways when they pull, which naturally encourages them to slow down. Combined with consistent training, most dogs improve significantly within 2-3 weeks. The back clip is there for when they've learned better walking habits.

**Is it safe for my dog's neck?**
Yes. Unlike collar-only walking, this harness distributes pressure across the chest and shoulders, avoiding throat strain. The padded chest panel spreads pressure comfortably, even if they do pull.

**How do I clean it?**
Wipe clean for daily dirt and mud. For deeper cleaning, hand wash with mild soap and air dry completely before next use. Don't machine wash, as it can damage the padding and mesh.

**What if it doesn't fit?**
Measure carefully before ordering. If it doesn't fit properly, contact us within 30 days and we'll help arrange a return or exchange under our Happy Tails Returns policy. Harnesses must be unused with tags still attached for hygiene reasons.

**Will the reflective strips actually keep my dog visible?**
Yes. When headlights hit the reflective strips, they light up significantly, making your dog visible from a distance. Especially helpful in winter when it's dark by 4pm in the UK.

**Can I use this for car travel?**
This harness is designed for walking and training, not car restraint. If you need in-car safety, look for a dedicated crash-tested car harness like the Kurgo Tru-Fit Enhanced Strength harness.

## Product 2: Kurgo Enhanced Strength Tru-Fit Crash-Tested Dog Car Harness (Medium)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What does "crash-tested" actually mean?**
Kurgo tests their harnesses to FMVSS 213 standards (the same used for child car seats in the US). This means the harness has been tested in simulated crash conditions. However, it's not UK legal certification. It's manufacturer testing designed to give you more confidence during car travel.

**Can I use this for everyday walks too?**
Yes. That's the point of this harness. The dual-use design means it's comfortable for daily walks (using the front or back D-ring) and can be used with the included tether for car journeys. One harness, two purposes.

**How do I know if Medium is the right size?**
Measure your dog's neck (40-63cm) and chest (46-71cm). Medium suits dogs roughly 11-23kg. If your dog is at the top end of Medium or bottom of Large, consider their build. Stocky breeds may need to size up for chest room.

**How short should the car tether be?**
Short enough that your dog can sit, stand, and lie down comfortably, but can't reach the front seats or driver area. Kurgo recommends the 10-inch tether for this reason. Too much slack defeats the purpose of restraint.

**What if my dog already has a harness they like?**
If they're happy with their walking harness, you can use this Kurgo purely for car travel and keep their usual harness for walks. Many dog owners have a "car harness" and a "walking harness" to keep things simple.

**How do I clean it after muddy trips?**
Machine wash on gentle cycle or hand wash with mild soap. Line dry completely before storing. Don't tumble dry, as heat can damage the steel buckles and padding.

**Does this work with any car?**
It works with any car that has standard seatbelt systems. The included carabiner clips to the harness and then connects to your seatbelt. Test the setup before your first journey to ensure it's secure and your dog is comfortable.

## Product 3: Elevated View Dog Booster Seat (Grey, Medium)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Will this fit my car?**
It fits most UK cars and can be used in front or back seats. The adjustable straps secure it to the seat. Check that your seat has a headrest or secure point for the straps to anchor to. Works with standard car seats, but may not fit bench seats without headrests.

**My dog gets anxious in the car. Will this help?**
Often, yes. Small dogs who can't see out the window tend to be more anxious because they can't see what's happening. The raised view helps them feel more secure and settled. It's not a guaranteed fix, but many anxious travellers calm down once they can see outside.

**What size dog does Medium suit?**
Dogs up to 11kg. Measure your dog's length from chest to tail base and height when sitting. The seat dimensions are roughly 40cm x 30cm x 25cm (check product specs). If your dog is close to 11kg or very long-bodied, it might feel cramped.

**Do I still need to use a harness and tether?**
Yes. The booster seat keeps them in one spot and gives them a raised view, but it's not a safety restraint on its own. Clip the safety clips to a harness (never a collar) and use a seatbelt tether for proper restraint during travel.

**How do I clean it after muddy paws?**
The wipe-clean outer handles most mess with a damp cloth. The soft removable cushion can be taken out and washed separately. Let it air dry completely before putting it back in.

**Will it fold flat for storage?**
Yes. It folds flatter when not in use, so you can store it in the boot or garage when you don't need it. Handy if you need the seat space back for human passengers or shopping.

**Can I use this in the front seat?**
You can, but check your car's airbag setup first. If the front passenger airbag can't be turned off, it's safer to use the booster in the back seat in case of deployment.

## Product 4: Elevated View Dog Booster Seat (Black, Medium)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the difference between the black and grey versions?**
Just the colour. The design, features, size, and function are identical. The black finish shows less dirt between washes, which some people prefer.

**Will this fit my car?**
It fits most UK cars and can be used in front or back seats. The adjustable straps secure it to the seat. Check that your seat has a headrest or secure point for the straps to anchor to. Works with standard car seats, but may not fit bench seats without headrests.

**My dog keeps trying to jump on my lap while I'm driving. Will this help?**
Yes. That's exactly what this is designed to prevent. The raised seat gives them their own secure spot with a clear view, and the harness clips keep them safely in position so they can't wander, slip, or lap-hop during the drive.

**What size dog does Medium suit?**
Dogs up to 11kg. Measure your dog's length from chest to tail base and height when sitting. The seat dimensions are roughly 40cm x 30cm x 25cm (check product specs). If your dog is close to 11kg or very long-bodied, it might feel cramped.

**Do I need to buy a separate harness?**
The booster seat has harness-attachment clips, but it doesn't include a harness. You'll need a separate walking or car harness to clip into the seat's safety clips. Never clip to a collar, as it's not safe in a moving vehicle.

**How do I clean it?**
Wipe the outer with a damp cloth for everyday dirt and paw prints. The removable cushion can be taken out and washed separately. Air dry completely before reassembling.

**Can I leave it in the car permanently?**
You can, but direct sunlight can fade the fabric over time and make it uncomfortably hot for your dog on sunny days. If you do leave it in the car, park in shade when possible or remove it on particularly hot days.

## Product 5: Two-Point Control Dog Lead (Brown, Training Lead)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**How does the two-point control actually work?**
You clip one end to the front D-ring of a no-pull harness and the other to the back D-ring. When your dog pulls forward, the front clip redirects them sideways, while the back clip provides stability. The pull distributes across two points instead of one, giving you kinder, more effective steering during training.

**Do I need a specific harness for this lead?**
You need a harness with both front and back D-rings (like the Rabbitgoo no-pull harness). It won't work with harnesses that only have one attachment point or with collars.

**Can I use it as a normal single lead?**
Yes. It converts to a single 120cm lead, so as your dog's training improves and they're walking calmly on a loose lead, you can switch to single-clip mode. One lead that grows with their skills.

**My hands hurt after long training walks. Will the padding help?**
Yes. The soft padded handles are designed to reduce hand pressure and prevent the lead cutting into your palms during training sessions. Much more comfortable than thin, unpadded leads, especially with strong pullers.

**Is the reflective stitching actually visible in the dark?**
Yes. The reflective stitching runs along the entire lead, so when headlights or torches hit it, the whole lead lights up. Makes a real difference during early morning or evening training walks, especially in winter when it's dark by 4pm.

**What if my dog tangles the two clips?**
The 360° swivel clips are designed to prevent tangling. They rotate naturally with your dog's movement and pace. You might get the occasional twist, but it's far less than with fixed clips.

**Will this stop my dog pulling?**
It's a training tool, not a magic fix. Combined with consistent loose-lead training, most dogs improve significantly within a few weeks. The two-point control makes it easier to redirect pulling behaviour, but you still need to teach them what you want.

## Product 6: Two-Point Control Dog Lead (Black, Training Lead)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the difference between the black and brown versions?**
Just the colour. The design, features, length, and function are identical. Choose whichever suits your style or matches your harness.

**How does the two-point control work for reactive dogs?**
For reactive dogs, the two-point system gives you better steering and redirection when they lunge or fixate. The front clip turns them away from the trigger, while the back clip keeps them grounded. It's especially helpful during behaviour work with a trainer.

**Do I need a specific harness for this lead?**
You need a harness with both front and back D-rings (like the Rabbitgoo no-pull harness). It won't work with harnesses that only have one attachment point or with collars.

**Can I use it for running or jogging?**
Once your dog is trained and walking calmly, yes. Convert it to single-lead mode and use the back clip only for running or jogging. The two-point mode is best for training sessions, not high-speed exercise.

**My hands hurt after long walks. Will this help?**
The soft padded handles reduce hand fatigue and prevent the lead cutting into your palms. Much more comfortable during longer training sessions, especially with enthusiastic pullers who are still learning.

**Is it suitable for small dogs?**
It's designed for medium to large dogs. For very small dogs (under 10kg), the dual clips might feel too heavy or cumbersome. Check the weight and clip size against your dog's harness before ordering.

**How do I stop the clips tangling?**
The 360° swivel clips rotate naturally with your dog's movement, preventing most tangles. If you do get a twist, stop for a moment and let your dog move around you in a circle to unwind it.

## Product 7: Pecute Retractable Dog Lead (10m, Heavy Duty)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Is 10m too long for everyday walks?**
For pavements and busy areas, yes. This lead is designed for open spaces like parks, beaches, and fields where your dog can safely explore further. Use the one-button brake to shorten it when you're near roads or other dogs.

**Will it work with my large dog (40kg+)?**
It's rated for dogs up to 50kg, so yes. The 304 stainless steel spring coils handle heavy-duty retraction smoothly. However, if your dog is a very strong puller, even at 40kg+, test it in a safe area first to ensure the brake holds reliably.

**How does the tangle-free mechanism work?**
The U-shaped guide and 360° swivel hook let the tape extend and retract at any angle without twisting. Your dog can move naturally in any direction without creating knots or tangles in the tape.

**What's the difference between this and the 5m lead?**
Length and weight capacity. This 10m lead is for bigger dogs (up to 50kg) who need more space in open areas. The 5m lead is better for medium dogs (up to 25kg) and everyday pavement walks where you don't need as much range.

**Does the brake actually hold with a strong dog?**
Yes, when used correctly. The one-button braking system locks the tape in place. However, if a 50kg dog hits the end of the lead at full sprint, there will be some jolt. Use the brake before they reach the end to avoid sudden stops.

**Can I use this at the beach?**
Yes, but rinse the mechanism with fresh water after beach trips to prevent salt and sand buildup. Let it dry completely before retracting and storing. Saltwater can corrode the spring over time if not cleaned.

**What if the tape gets damaged?**
Contact the manufacturer (Pecute) for replacement tape if it frays or tears. Don't use a damaged tape, as it can snap unexpectedly and injure you or your dog.

## Product 8: TUG Retractable Dog Lead (5m, Black, Medium)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Is 5m enough space for my dog?**
For everyday walks on pavements, in parks, and around the neighbourhood, yes. It gives them enough range to explore and sniff without wandering too far. If you want more space for wide-open areas like beaches or fields, consider the 10m version.

**What size dog is this suitable for?**
Medium dogs up to 25kg. If your dog is heavier or a very strong puller, the 10m heavy-duty version (rated up to 50kg) would be a better choice.

**How does the one-handed brake work?**
Thumb control lets you pause, lock, or release the lead instantly without breaking stride. Press the button to lock, release to extend, and use the pause function for quick stops when needed (like at kerbs or when other dogs approach).

**Will the tape tangle if my dog changes direction?**
The 360° tangle-free design prevents most twisting. The tape extends and retracts smoothly even when your dog moves in circles or changes direction quickly. You might get the occasional twist, but it's minimal.

**Can I use this for training?**
Retractable leads aren't ideal for loose-lead training, as the constant tension can encourage pulling. Use a fixed-length training lead (like the two-point control lead) for training, then switch to this for freedom during sniffy walks once they've learned good habits.

**How do I clean it if it gets muddy?**
Wipe the tape clean with a damp cloth before retracting it fully. If the mechanism gets gritty, you can extend the tape fully and wipe it down with a slightly damp cloth, then let it air dry before retracting and storing.

**What if the brake stops working?**
Stop using it immediately. A faulty brake is a safety risk. Contact the manufacturer or retailer for a replacement. Never try to repair the internal mechanism yourself, as it's under spring tension.

## Product 9: TUG Retractable Dog Lead (5m, Green, Medium)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the difference between the green and black versions?**
Just the colour. The design, features, length, weight capacity, and function are identical. The green version is easier to spot if you drop it in grass or during outdoor adventures.

**Is 5m enough space for my dog?**
For everyday walks on pavements, in parks, and around the neighbourhood, yes. It gives them enough range to explore and sniff without wandering too far. If you want more space for wide-open areas like beaches or fields, consider the 10m version.

**What size dog is this suitable for?**
Medium dogs up to 25kg. If your dog is heavier or a very strong puller, the 10m heavy-duty version (rated up to 50kg) would be a better choice.

**How reliable is the brake with a pulling dog?**
The one-handed brake system locks reliably when used correctly. However, if your dog hits the end of the lead at full speed, there will be some jolt. Use the brake function before they reach the end to slow them down gradually.

**Can I use this for recall training?**
It's not ideal for formal recall training, as retractable leads create constant tension. Use a long training line (10-15m fixed length) for recall work, then use this for freedom walks once their recall is solid.

**What if my dog is between sizes (22-27kg)?**
At 22-25kg, this 5m medium lead should be fine if your dog isn't a heavy puller. If they're 25kg+ or very strong, the 10m heavy-duty version (up to 50kg) would be safer and more durable long-term.

**How do I maintain it?**
Keep the tape clean by wiping before retraction. Don't let it drag on the ground when fully extended, as grit and dirt can damage the internal mechanism. Store it dry and avoid leaving it in direct sunlight for extended periods.

## Product 10: Flatbed Back-Seat Extender (M/L, Hard Base)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Will this fit my car?**
It's designed for most UK cars and SUVs, fitting the back seat area. Measure your back seat width and footwell depth before ordering. It works best with cars that have a relatively flat footwell (not steeply angled). Check the product dimensions against your car's back seat.

**Do I still need a harness and tether?**
Yes. This extender creates a flatter, more comfortable surface for your dog, but it's not a safety restraint. Your dog should still be secured with a harness and seatbelt tether while the car is moving.

**My dog slides into the footwell during braking. Will this fix it?**
Yes. That's exactly what it's designed to prevent. The hard-base support bridges the gap between the back seat and footwell, creating a flat surface so your dog can settle comfortably without sliding into awkward positions during braking or cornering.

**How do I keep it in place?**
The extender has anchor straps and a grippy underside to reduce shifting. Secure the straps to your seat anchors or headrests (depending on design) and ensure the grippy side is facing down against your seat fabric.

**Can I still fold the back seats down with this installed?**
You'll need to remove it first. It's designed to sit on top of the back seats and footwell, so it will block the folding mechanism. However, it's relatively quick to take out and put back in when needed.

**How do I clean it after muddy trips?**
The wipe-clean fabric handles most mess with a damp cloth. For deeper cleaning, remove it from the car and hose it down outside, then let it air dry completely before reinstalling.

**Will it protect my car seats from claws and hair?**
Yes. The extender covers the back seats and door areas, protecting upholstery from scuffs, scratches, hair, and muddy paws. It's a practical barrier between your dog and your car's interior.

**What's the difference between M/L sizes?**
Check the product specifications for exact dimensions. M/L typically refers to fitment across medium to large car back seats. If you have a very small car (like a Fiat 500) or a very large SUV (like a Range Rover), measure first to ensure proper fit.
