## Testimonial 1: Rabbitgoo No-Pull Harness

**Customer Persona:** Emma, Border Collie owner, Manchester

**Testimonial:**
"I've been through three harnesses in two years trying to stop Alfie pulling me down the street. This one actually works. The front clip turns him back towards me when he lunges at squirrels, which has made our morning walks so much less stressful. Still a work in progress, but I can finally hold a coffee in one hand again."

**Where to use:** Rabbitgoo harness product page, homepage testimonial section

---

## Testimonial 2: Kurgo Car Harness

**Customer Persona:** James, Labrador owner, Bristol

**Testimonial:**
"My dog used to climb all over the back seats and stick his head between the front seats while I was driving. Properly stressful on motorways. Since using this harness with the tether, he settles down within five minutes and actually sleeps on longer trips. Wish I'd bought it years ago."

**Where to use:** Kurgo car harness product page, car safety collection

## Testimonial 3: Elevated Dog Booster Seat

**Customer Persona:** Sarah, Jack Russell owner, Edinburgh

**Testimonial:**
"Rosie used to shake and whine the entire car journey because she couldn't see out the window. The booster seat has completely changed car trips for us. She sits there calm as anything, watching the world go by. It's like having a different dog in the car."

**Where to use:** Booster seat product page, car safety collection

---

## Testimonial 4: Two-Point Control Training Lead

**Customer Persona:** David, Springer Spaniel owner, Cardiff

**Testimonial:**
"Training a springer to walk nicely is hard work. The two-point lead gives me so much more control when he gets excited by other dogs or bikes. The padded handles are brilliant too, my hands don't ache anymore after an hour's training session."

**Where to use:** Two-point lead product page, walking essentials collection

---

## Testimonial 5: Retractable Lead (10m)

**Customer Persona:** Lisa, German Shepherd owner, Lake District

**Testimonial:**
"We're surrounded by fields and open spaces, so a normal 2m lead felt cruel. The 10m retractable gives my dog proper freedom to explore while I can still call him back if sheep appear. The brake is solid, even with a 35kg shepherd hitting the end at speed."

**Where to use:** Pecute 10m retractable lead, outdoor adventures collection

---

## Testimonial 6: Lick Mat

**Customer Persona:** Rachel, Cocker Spaniel owner, Brighton

**Testimonial:**
"Bath time used to be an absolute nightmare. Barking, squirming, trying to escape. I spread peanut butter on the lick mat, stick it to the bath tiles, and she's completely focused on that instead of panicking. Makes nail trimming possible too. Genuinely life-changing for us."

**Where to use:** Lick mat product page, pet comfort & care collection

---

## Testimonial 7: Slow Feeder Bowl

**Customer Persona:** Tom, Beagle owner, London

**Testimonial:**
"Our beagle inhales his food in about 20 seconds flat, then spends the next hour looking uncomfortable and bloated. The slow feeder bowl forces him to take his time. Meals now last a good five minutes, and he's not sick afterwards. Simple fix, big difference."

**Where to use:** Slow feeder bowl product page, pet comfort & care collection

---

## Testimonial 8: Pet Wipes

**Customer Persona:** Claire, Cockapoo owner, Surrey

**Testimonial:**
"British weather means muddy walks pretty much year-round. These wipes are thick enough to actually clean muddy paws properly without falling apart, and they don't have that overpowering chemical smell. I keep a pack in the car and a pack at home."

**Where to use:** Pet wipes product page, outdoor adventures collection

---

## Testimonial 9: Flatbed Back-Seat Extender

**Customer Persona:** Mark, Whippet owner, Yorkshire

**Testimonial:**
"Whippets are bony, anxious little things, and mine used to slide into the footwell every time I braked. The flatbed extender gives him a proper flat surface to lie on, and he's so much more settled on car journeys now. Plus it protects the seats from his claws."

**Where to use:** Flatbed extender product page, car safety collection

---

## Testimonial 10: Hard-Shell Pet Carrier

**Customer Persona:** Helen, Cat owner, Glasgow

**Testimonial:**
"Vet visits are stressful enough without wrestling a terrified cat into a carrier. The top opening on this one is brilliant. I can just lift her in from above instead of trying to shove her through the front door while she's clinging to everything. Makes a horrible job slightly less horrible."

**Where to use:** Hard-shell carrier product page, cat travel collection

---

## Alternative Format: "Team Tested" Approach

If you're uncomfortable with created testimonials, use this format instead:

### Example: "Team Tested by Sarah (HappyPawsCo)"

**Copy:**
"I've been using the Rabbitgoo harness with my Border Collie for three months now. The front clip has genuinely improved his pulling behaviour, and the reflective strips are properly visible when car headlights hit them during our early morning walks. Still got work to do on his squirrel obsession, but we're getting there."

**Why this works:**
- Honest and specific
- Shows real usage over time
- Admits it's not perfect (builds trust)
- You can add real photos of your team/friends with their dogs

---

## Implementation Suggestions

**Where to add testimonials:**

1. **Homepage:**
   - Create a "What Our Customers Say" section
   - Use 3-4 of the best testimonials
   - Add customer names and locations (or "Team Tested by [Name]")

2. **Product Pages:**
   - Add 1-2 relevant testimonials just above "Add to Cart" button
   - Or use a testimonial carousel at the bottom of the description

3. **Collection Pages:**
   - Add relevant testimonials to category description sections
   - Example: Car safety collection shows car harness + booster seat testimonials

**Visual format:**
- Customer name and location (or "Team Tested by [Name]")
- 2-3 sentence quote
- Optional: Star rating (4-5 stars)
- Optional: Photo of customer with their dog (with permission)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Use stock photos of dogs (customers will spot this)
- ❌ Make them too perfect/salesy ("Best product ever!")
- ❌ Make them too long (people skim)
- ❌ Use the same testimonial across multiple products

## Post-Launch Plan

**Replace created testimonials with real ones ASAP:**

1. **Week 1-2:** Use email automation to request reviews from first customers
2. **Week 3-4:** Replace created testimonials with real customer reviews
3. **Month 2:** Add photo reviews if customers submit them
4. **Month 3:** Create video testimonials (if customers willing)

**Review request email template:**
Subject: How's [Product Name] working for you and [Dog Name]?

Body:
"Hi [Name],

You ordered [product name] a couple of weeks ago. We'd love to know how it's working for [dog name].

If you have 2 minutes, would you mind leaving a quick review? It really helps other dog owners make the right choice.

Thanks,
[Your name]
HappyPawsCo"

## Final Notes

**Authenticity is everything.**

People can spot fake testimonials a mile off. If you use these drafts:
- Edit them to sound even more natural
- Add real names (team/friends) if possible
- Be prepared to replace them with real customer reviews quickly
- Consider the "Team Tested" approach as a more honest alternative

**The goal:** Get through launch with some social proof, then replace with genuine customer voices as soon as possible.
