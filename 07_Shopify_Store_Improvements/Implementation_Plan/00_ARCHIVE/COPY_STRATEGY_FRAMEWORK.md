**Date:** December 29, 2024

## My Copy Framework: Hybrid Approach

### Primary Framework: **AIDA + E-E-A-T + Conversion Psychology**

**Why This Combination:**
- **AIDA:** Proven conversion structure (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)
- **E-E-A-T:** Google's quality signals (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
- **Conversion Psychology:** Addresses objections, builds trust, reduces friction

**How They Work Together:**
- AIDA provides structure
- E-E-A-T ensures quality and trust
- Conversion Psychology addresses real buying barriers

---

## The Framework Breakdown

### 1. AIDA Structure (Conversion Flow)

#### **A - Attention (Hook)**
- **Current:** Product title + opening line
- **Goal:** Stop the scroll, address immediate need
- **Your Brand Voice:** Relatable problem statement
- **Length:** 1-2 sentences max

**Example:**
- ❌ Generic: "Premium dog harness for car travel"
- ✅ Your Voice: "Walks should feel safe for both of you. But when your dog pulls or tries to escape, that safety disappears."

#### **I - Interest (Problem + Solution)**
- **Current:** Product features
- **Goal:** Show you understand their pain, introduce solution
- **Your Brand Voice:** Empathetic acknowledgment + practical solution
- **Length:** 2-3 short paragraphs

**Example:**
- ❌ Generic: "This harness features padded chest panel and escape-resistant design"
- ✅ Your Voice: "I know that feeling when your dog lunges at a squirrel and you're left with a sore shoulder. This harness spreads the pressure across a padded chest panel, so sudden pulls don't yank your arm off. The escape-resistant design means they can't slip out, even if they try to back out of it."

#### **D - Desire (Benefits + Proof)**
- **Current:** Product specs
- **Goal:** Make them want it, show it works
- **Your Brand Voice:** Specific benefits, honest about what it does
- **Length:** Bullet points + short paragraphs

**Example:**
- ❌ Generic: "High-quality materials, durable construction"
- ✅ Your Voice: "Oxford nylon that's tough enough for daily walks but soft enough not to chafe. We've used this for our own pack for months, and it's still going strong. The reflective strips mean you're both visible on those dark winter walks back to the car."

#### **A - Action (Clear CTA + Remove Friction)**
- **Current:** "Add to Cart" button
- **Goal:** Make buying easy, address last-minute concerns
- **Your Brand Voice:** Helpful, not pushy
- **Length:** 1-2 sentences + trust signals

**Example:**
- ❌ Generic: "Buy now!"
- ✅ Your Voice: "Check the size guide below to make sure you get the right fit. Free UK delivery, 30-day returns if it's not quite right."

---

### 2. E-E-A-T Integration (Trust & Quality)

#### **E - Experience**
- **Show:** "We use this ourselves" or "I've tested this"
- **Your Voice:** Personal anecdotes, real usage
- **Placement:** Throughout copy, not just at end

**Example:**
- "I've been using this for my own anxious dog for six months, and it's made car journeys actually enjoyable."

#### **E - Expertise**
- **Show:** Specific knowledge, UK context, practical tips
- **Your Voice:** Helpful advice, not lecturing
- **Placement:** Sizing guides, care instructions, usage tips

**Example:**
- "For UK winters, the reflective strips are essential. Dark by 4pm means you need visibility, not just style."

#### **A - Authoritativeness**
- **Show:** Highway Code compliance, safety standards, certifications
- **Your Voice:** Factual, not bragging
- **Placement:** Specifications section, trust signals

**Example:**
- "Highway Code Rule 57 compliant. Crash-tested to distribute force across the chest, not the neck."

#### **T - Trustworthiness**
- **Show:** Honest about limitations, clear returns policy, real reviews
- **Your Voice:** Transparent, helpful
- **Placement:** FAQ section, product details, checkout

**Example:**
- "Not suitable for dogs under 5kg - check our size guide. If it doesn't work for your dog, 30-day returns, no questions asked."

---

### 3. Conversion Psychology (Remove Barriers)

#### **Objection Handling**
- **Address:** "Will it fit?", "Is it worth it?", "What if it doesn't work?"
- **Your Voice:** Anticipate concerns, answer honestly
- **Placement:** FAQ section, product details

**Example:**
- "Worried about sizing? We've included a detailed measurement guide. If you're between sizes, go up - better too loose than too tight."

#### **Social Proof**
- **Show:** Reviews, usage examples, "others also bought"
- **Your Voice:** Real experiences, not fake testimonials
- **Placement:** Reviews section, related products

**Example:**
- "UK dog owners love this for daily walks and car journeys. See what they're saying in reviews below."

#### **Scarcity (Honest)**
- **Show:** Stock levels (if low), seasonal relevance
- **Your Voice:** Helpful, not manipulative
- **Placement:** Product availability, seasonal messaging

**Example:**
- "Popular for winter walks - we're restocking weekly. Order now for delivery before the weekend."

#### **Risk Reversal**
- **Show:** Returns policy, guarantees, support
- **Your Voice:** Reassuring, not defensive
- **Placement:** Checkout, product page footer

**Example:**
- "30-day returns if it's not right for your dog. We're here to help you find the right gear."

**Below the Fold (Remaining content):**
- **Can include:** Detailed specs, FAQs, size guides
- **Can be:** More comprehensive
- **Structure:** Collapsible sections, tabs, accordions

### Scannability Framework

- Headline: Clear benefit
- Subheadings: Key points
- Bullet points: Main features/benefits
- CTA: Visible and clear

**For Detail Seekers (20% of visitors):**
- Expandable sections: Full details
- FAQ: All questions answered
- Size guide: Complete measurements
- Specifications: Technical details

## Before/After Example

```

Add to Cart
```

### AFTER (Improved - Your Voice + Framework):
```
Reflective No-Pull Dog Harness

Walks should feel safe for both of you. But when your dog pulls or tries to 
escape, that safety disappears. I've been there with my own anxious dog, and 
this harness changed everything.

The padded chest panel spreads pressure across their chest (not your shoulder) 
when they pull. The escape-resistant design means they can't slip out, even if 
they try to back out of it. And those reflective strips? Essential for UK 
winters when it's dark by 4pm.

We use this for our own pack because it's tough enough for daily walks but 
comfortable enough they don't fight putting it on. Highway Code Rule 57 
compliant for car travel too.

Quick question: Are you worried about sizing? We've got a detailed size guide 
that takes the guesswork out. Or maybe you're not sure if it's right for your 
dog? 30-day returns means you can try it risk-free.

### Email 2: Value Add (24 hours after)

Your Dog'. It covers sizing, fit, and what to look for. No sales pitch, just 
helpful info.

### Email 3: Gentle Nudge (3 days after)
- **Framework:** Action + Risk Reversal
- **Voice:** Friendly, helpful
- **Goal:** Final reminder, remove last barriers

Last chance on that [Product] in your basket. We're restocking soon, and 
popular sizes tend to go quickly.

[Complete Purchase]

If you've changed your mind, that's totally fine. Just let me know if there's 
anything else we can help with.

Kyle

**Note:** Only use discount codes if you have a specific strategy. Often, 
helpful content and removing friction works better than discounts.

## Preservation Protocol

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Elements I Will NOT Touch

**Before making ANY changes, I will:**
1. Document all existing elements on each product page
2. Identify and preserve:
   - ✅ Safety information and safety pics (PRESERVE EXACTLY)
   - ✅ Internal links ("pair with" sections) (PRESERVE EXACTLY)
   - ✅ Variant references ("Prefer black?") (PRESERVE EXACTLY)
   - ✅ Hero product designations (PRESERVE EXACTLY)
   - ✅ Existing page structure (WORK WITH, don't replace)

**My approach:**
- Enhance existing copy (improve wording, keep structure)
- Add new sections (size guides, FAQs) in NEW areas
- Work AROUND your existing elements
- Never remove or modify your preserved elements

**See:** `PRESERVATION_CHECKLIST.md` for complete details

---

## Next Steps

**Before I Start:**
1. ✅ You review this framework
2. ✅ Confirm approach works for you
3. ✅ Share any specific concerns

**Then I'll:**

3. Extract Amazon product specs
4. Create improvement plan (show you before changes)
5. Get your approval
6. Make changes (enhance existing, add new sections)
