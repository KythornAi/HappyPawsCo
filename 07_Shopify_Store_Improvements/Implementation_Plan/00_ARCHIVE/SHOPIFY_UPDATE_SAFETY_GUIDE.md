## Can I Update Your Shopify Pages?

### ✅ YES - I Can Update Shopify Pages

**How it works:**
- You give me access to Shopify admin (or share theme files)
- I can read and edit product pages, theme code, settings
- I can make changes directly in Shopify

**What I can update:**
- ✅ Product descriptions and copy
- ✅ Product specifications and details
- ✅ Meta descriptions
- ✅ Theme code (CSS, HTML, Liquid)
- ✅ Announcement bar copy
- ✅ Collection descriptions
- ✅ Blog posts

**What I need:**
- Access to Shopify admin (you can grant temporary access)
- OR: You can share theme files, I'll provide code, you paste it in

## Password Protection - No Problem!

### ✅ Your Shop Can Stay Password Protected

**Good news:** Password protection doesn't affect my ability to:
- Access Shopify admin
- Edit products and pages
- Modify theme code
- Make updates

**Why this is safe:**
- I'm working in the admin area (backend)
- Password protection only affects the storefront (frontend)
- Customers can't see changes until you remove password
- Perfect for pre-launch work!

**Recommendation:** Keep it password protected while we work. Remove password only when ready to launch.

## BACKUP STRATEGY - CRITICAL! ⚠️

### ✅ YES - Create a Backup Before We Start

**Why this is essential:**
- You've worked countless hours on the shop
- Better safe than sorry
- Easy to restore if anything goes wrong
- Peace of mind while we work

### How to Create a Backup

#### Method 1: Duplicate Theme (RECOMMENDED) ⭐

**Step 1: Duplicate Your Current Theme**
1. Go to Shopify Admin → Online Store → Themes
2. Find your current theme (probably "Dawn" or custom theme)
3. Click "..." (three dots) → "Duplicate"
4. Name it: "Backup - [Date]" (e.g., "Backup - Dec 29 2024")
5. This creates a complete copy

**Step 2: Work on Original, Keep Backup Safe**
- We'll make changes to your main theme
- Backup stays untouched
- If anything goes wrong, switch back to backup

**Step 3: If Something Goes Wrong**
1. Go to Themes
2. Click "..." on backup theme → "Publish"
3. Your shop is restored instantly

**Time:** 2 minutes
**Protection:** Complete theme backup

---

#### Method 2: Export Theme (EXTRA SAFETY)

**Step 1: Export Current Theme**
1. Go to Themes
2. Click "..." on your theme → "Download"
3. Saves as .zip file
4. Store in safe location (your computer, cloud backup)

**Step 2: Keep Export Safe**
- This is your "nuclear option"
- Can re-upload if needed
- Good for long-term backup

**Time:** 5 minutes
**Protection:** Complete theme file backup

---

#### Method 3: Version History (AUTOMATIC)

**Shopify automatically:**
- Keeps version history of theme changes
- You can revert to previous versions
- Access via: Themes → "..." → "Edit code" → "History"

**But:** This only works for theme code, not product changes

**Recommendation:** Use Method 1 (duplicate theme) + Method 3 (version history)

## CSS Header Jitter Investigation

### ✅ YES - I Can Access and Investigate

**What I can do:**
- Read your theme CSS files
- Identify the jitter issue
- Provide fix code
- Test the solution

**How it works:**

#### Option A: I Access Theme Files Directly
1. You grant me access to Shopify admin
2. I navigate to: Themes → Edit Code
3. I read CSS files (usually in `assets/` or `sections/`)
4. I identify the issue
5. I provide fix code
6. You approve, I apply

#### Option B: You Share Theme Files
1. You export theme (or copy CSS files)
2. Share files with me
3. I analyze and provide fix
4. You paste code back into Shopify

**What I'll investigate:**
- Announcement bar CSS
- Header scroll behavior
- Animation properties
- Height calculations
- Transform vs. margin/padding issues

**Expected outcome:**
- 80% chance: Simple CSS fix (I can do this)
- 20% chance: Requires custom JavaScript (might need developer)

**Time:** 30-60 minutes for investigation + fix
