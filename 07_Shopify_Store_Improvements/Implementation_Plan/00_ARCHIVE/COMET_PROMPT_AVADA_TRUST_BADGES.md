TESTING CHECKLIST:

After setup, please check:
- [ ] Badges appear on homepage
- [ ] Badges appear on all product pages
- [ ] Product-specific badges ONLY show on correct products (check Kurgo harness has crash-tested badge, check Lick Mat has BPA-free badge, etc.)
- [ ] Badges appear on cart page
- [ ] Badges appear on checkout page
- [ ] Mobile: Badges are readable and don't break layout
- [ ] Desktop: Badges display properly in a row
- [ ] No weird spacing or overlapping

---

If Avada doesn't support product-specific badges (some apps don't), just set up the 4 CORE badges (1-4) on all pages, and we'll add product-specific badges manually later.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have questions!
```

## Additional Notes for You

**If Comet asks questions:**

1. **"What's the brand color?"** → Check your Shopify theme settings, or say "neutral beige/cream tones to match our current product page background"

2. **"Which position looks better - above or below Add to Cart?"** → Test both, but **below is usually better** (doesn't push the button down the page)

3. **"Avada doesn't support product-specific badges"** → That's fine, just do the 4 core badges for now. We can add product-specific badges manually later using product tags or metafields.

4. **"How do I make badges show only on certain products?"** →
   - Option 1: Use Avada's "Display Rules" (if available) to target specific product titles or tags
   - Option 2: Add product tags in Shopify first, then use Avada to target those tags
   - Option 3: Skip product-specific badges for now, just do core badges

**Product Tags to Add (if Comet needs them):**

Go to each product in Shopify → Add tags:

- Kurgo Harness → Add tag: `crash-tested`
- Reflective harnesses (3 products) → Add tag: `reflective`
- BPA-free products (6 products) → Add tag: `BPA-free`
- Dishwasher safe products (4 products) → Add tag: `dishwasher-safe`

Then Comet can set Avada to show specific badges when products have specific tags.
