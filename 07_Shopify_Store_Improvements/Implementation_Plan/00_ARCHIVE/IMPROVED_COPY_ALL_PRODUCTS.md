For each product, I will:

1. **Extract current copy from CSV**
2. **Identify preserved elements:**
   - Safety notes, reassurance sections
   - "Pairs well with" sections
   - Variant references
   - Size/measurement data
3. **Determine product type & persona**
4. **Apply conversational brand voice:**
   - Relatable opening hook
   - Varied social proof phrasing
   - UK context
   - Light humour where appropriate
5. **Preserve all critical elements**
6. **Create HTML-formatted improved copy**
