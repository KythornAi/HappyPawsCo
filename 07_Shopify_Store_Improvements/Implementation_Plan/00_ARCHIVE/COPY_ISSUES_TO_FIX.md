# Product Copy Issues - Urgent Fix Required
**Date:** December 30, 2024
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. EM-DASHES USED THROUGHOUT (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Em-dashes (–) are AI writing indicators that cause customers to abandon
**Status:** ❌ Used extensively in ALL_PRODUCTS_IMPROVED_COPY.md
**Impact:** HIGH - Customers will recognize AI writing and leave

**Must fix:** Remove ALL em-dashes and replace with:
- Periods (start new sentence)
- Commas with conjunctions (and, but, so)
- Semicolons
- Rephrase entirely

### 2. FORCED/WEDGED PHRASING
**Problem:** Some clarifying language feels forced or unnaturally inserted
**Status:** ❌ Present in multiple products
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Sounds robotic, not conversational

**Examples of forced phrasing:**
- Overly direct quotes from clarifying session
- Awkward sentence structures
- UK context that feels wedged in

---

## Action Required

**REWRITE ALL 24 PRODUCTS** with:
1. ✅ ZERO em-dashes
2. ✅ Natural, flowing language
3. ✅ UK context woven in (not forced)
4. ✅ Conversational tone throughout
5. ✅ All preserved elements intact
