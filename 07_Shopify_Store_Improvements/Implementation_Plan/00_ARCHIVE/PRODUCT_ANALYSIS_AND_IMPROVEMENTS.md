## Analysis Summary

I've reviewed your product export CSV and Amazon URLs file. Here's what I found:

### Current Product Copy Quality: **GOOD** ✅

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Benefit-focused language
- ✅ Specific sizing information
- ✅ Safety notes included
- ✅ Internal links to related products
- ✅ Variant references ("Need a different size?")

**What I'll Preserve:**
- ✅ All safety notes and warnings
- ✅ All internal links ("Shop Size L", "Pair with" sections)
- ✅ All variant references ("Prefer black?", hero product mentions)
- ✅ Existing structure and organization
- ✅ Your current tone and voice elements

**What I'll Enhance:**
- ✅ Strengthen opening hooks (more relatable problem statements)
- ✅ Add more E-E-A-T elements (experience, expertise)
