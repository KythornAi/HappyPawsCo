# Before/After Prompt Comparison

## Overview

**Original Prompt:** 4,200 characters
**Enhanced Prompt:** 15,541 characters (270% increase)

---

## ISSUE 1: Text Appearing in Images

### BEFORE (Original Prompt)
```
VISUAL QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Composition: Upper third has COPY SPACE for text overlay

ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
❌ No text overlays in the image itself (copy space only)
```

**Problem:** Brief mention, no emphasis, no examples

---

### AFTER (Enhanced Prompt)
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🚨 ABSOLUTE #1 RULE - NO TEXT IN IMAGES 🚨
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⛔ DO NOT generate ANY text, words, letters, numbers, or typography IN the image itself
⛔ DO NOT create headlines, titles, or captions AS PART of the visual
⛔ DO NOT render any readable text overlays, watermarks, or labels
⛔ The "visual" field describes a PHOTOGRAPH ONLY - pure imagery with NO text elements

✅ CORRECT: "A photograph of a Golden Retriever sleeping in a grey pet bed by a window"
❌ WRONG: "A pin showing 'Best Dog Beds 2024' text over a photo of a dog in a bed"

The upper third should be CLEAR COPY SPACE (blank area or soft gradient) where Canva will ADD text later.
You are creating the BASE PHOTOGRAPH only. Text will be added in post-production.

REPEAT: Zero text in the actual image. Copy space means EMPTY SPACE for future text overlay.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Plus:**
- Dedicated "COPY SPACE REQUIREMENTS" section (full page)
- Added to pre-submission checklist
- Mentioned in final reminder
- Built into visual field template

**Impact:** Rule stated 5+ times with examples, impossible to miss

## ISSUE 2: Pets Halfway Out of Products

### BEFORE (Original Prompt)
```
IF blog mentions car products (hammocks, harnesses, carriers, seats):
- Show them INSIDE vehicles (back seat or boot)
- Dog/cat must be IN/ON the product, not just near it
- Car interior must be visible and realistic
```

**Problem:** Vague "IN/ON product" doesn't prevent halfway positions

---

### AFTER (Enhanced Prompt)
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🚨 CRITICAL RULE #2 - REALISTIC PRODUCT USAGE 🚨
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⛔ NO pets halfway out of hammocks/beds/carriers (unrealistic and unusable)
⛔ NO pets partially visible or awkwardly positioned
⛔ NO floating products or products without pets actively using them

✅ CORRECT: "Cocker Spaniel fully settled inside grey car hammock in back seat"
❌ WRONG: "Dog's head and front paws in hammock, rear half hanging out"

✅ CORRECT: "Tabby cat completely curled up in round pet bed, sleeping peacefully"
❌ WRONG: "Cat with only front half in bed, back legs on floor"

The pet must be COMPLETELY and COMFORTABLY using the product as intended.
If you wouldn't publish it in a pet magazine, don't generate it.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Plus:**
- Updated EVERY product category with "fully visible, properly positioned"
- Added "IF blog mentions bedding/sleep products" section specifically addressing this
- Added to pre-submission checklist

## ISSUE 3: Inconsistent Visual Style Across 3 Pins

### BEFORE (Original Prompt)
```
BREED & SETTING VARIETY (FOR 3 PINS):
- Pin 1: One breed in appropriate setting
- Pin 2: Different breed, slightly different angle/lighting
- Pin 3: Different breed, alternative use scenario

VISUAL QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Lighting: Soft natural daylight (UK window light, slightly overcast is fine)
- Style: Editorial pet lifestyle, warm, realistic British homes
```

**Problem:** "Slightly different angle/lighting" actually causes inconsistency

---

### AFTER (Enhanced Prompt)
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎨 VISUAL COHESION RULES - ALL 3 PINS MUST MATCH 🎨
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

These 3 pins will be posted together as a SET - they MUST look cohesive and branded.

MANDATORY CONSISTENCY ACROSS ALL 3 PINS:

1. COLOR PALETTE (IDENTICAL for all 3):
   - Primary: Warm earth tones (#937F71 warm taupe, #EEECE6 cream, #E0CFBD beige)
   - Accent: Soft sage green, dusty rose, warm grey
   - Avoid: Bright primary colors, neon, stark white, harsh blacks
   - All 3 pins should feel like they're from the same brand photoshoot

2. LIGHTING QUALITY (IDENTICAL for all 3):
   - Soft, diffused natural daylight (overcast UK window light)
   - Same time of day (morning or afternoon, not mixed)
   - Consistent shadow softness and direction
   - Same warmth/coolness temperature (all warm OR all cool, not mixed)

3. PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE (IDENTICAL for all 3):
   - Editorial lifestyle aesthetic (not stock photo generic)
   - 85mm lens at f/1.8-f/2.8 (shallow depth of field)
   - Same level of background blur across all 3
   - Professional, cinematic quality
   - Same post-processing look (slightly desaturated, film-like)

4. SETTING AESTHETIC (COHESIVE across all 3):
   - All pins set in authentic British homes (terraced houses, cottages, flats, gardens)
   - Similar decor style (modern farmhouse, Scandi-minimalist, or cosy traditional - pick ONE)
   - Consistent props (similar textures: linen, wood, ceramic)
   - Same level of "lived-in" authenticity

✅ GOOD SET EXAMPLE:
   - Pin 1: Labrador in grey bed, morning light, warm tones, modern farmhouse living room
   - Pin 2: Cocker Spaniel in same grey bed, same morning light, warm tones, similar modern farmhouse bedroom
   - Pin 3: French Bulldog in same grey bed, same morning light, warm tones, modern farmhouse conservatory
   → All feel like one cohesive brand campaign

❌ BAD SET EXAMPLE:
   - Pin 1: Labrador in bed, bright harsh sunlight, white walls, modern minimalist
   - Pin 2: Cocker Spaniel in bed, dim evening light, dark moody tones, rustic cottage
   - Pin 3: French Bulldog in bed, overcast daylight, colorful playful decor, eclectic flat
   → Looks like 3 random pins from different brands
```

**Plus:**
- Specific color codes mandated
- "IDENTICAL" emphasized for lighting/colors/style
- Good vs bad set examples
- Added to pre-submission checklist (4 separate checks)

**Impact:** Changed from "slightly different" to "identically cohesive"

---

## ISSUE 4: Copy Space for Canva Overlays

### BEFORE (Original Prompt)
```
VISUAL QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Composition: Upper third has COPY SPACE for text overlay
```

**Problem:** No details on what copy space means or how to achieve it

---

### AFTER (Enhanced Prompt)
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📋 COPY SPACE REQUIREMENTS 📋
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Upper Third of Every Pin (Top 1/3 of 9:16 frame):
⛔ NO busy backgrounds (avoid shelves, artwork, cluttered walls)
⛔ NO pets' faces or main subject in this zone
⛔ NO detailed textures or distracting elements

✅ IDEAL copy space zones:
- Soft gradient wall (cream to warm taupe)
- Out-of-focus blank wall area
- Blurred window with diffused light
- Soft bokeh background
- Plain painted wall (slightly out of focus)

The copy space should be BORING and EMPTY - perfect for text overlay.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Plus:**
- Built into visual field template
- Added to pre-submission checklist
- Mentioned in text warning section

**Impact:** Specific examples of what works, what doesn't

### BEFORE (Original Prompt)
```

- Pin 2: Different breed, slightly different angle/lighting
- Pin 3: Different breed, alternative use scenario

Example breeds: Labrador, Cocker Spaniel, French Bulldog, Beagle, British Shorthair, Tabby
```

**Problem:** No clear framework for what makes angles different/valuable

📐 THE 3 PERSONAS/ANGLES (Different but Cohesive) 📐
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

While maintaining visual cohesion, create 3 DISTINCT perspectives:

PIN 1 - CLOSE-UP DETAIL SHOT:
- Focus: Intimate view of pet + product interaction
- Framing: Tight on pet's face/body while using product
- Shows: Product details, pet's contentment, texture close-up
- Example: "Close-up of Golden Retriever's peaceful face as she sleeps in grey orthopedic bed, showing cushion texture and comfort"
- Breed: Choose one (e.g., Labrador, Golden Retriever, Cocker Spaniel)
- Setting: One UK room type (e.g., living room corner by window)

PIN 2 - MID-RANGE LIFESTYLE SHOT:
- Focus: Pet using product in realistic home context
- Framing: Mid-distance showing pet, product, and immediate surroundings
- Shows: How product fits into UK home life, practical usage
- Example: "Cocker Spaniel fully curled in grey orthopedic bed beside fireplace in cosy British cottage living room"
- Breed: DIFFERENT from Pin 1 (e.g., if Pin 1 was Labrador, use Spaniel)
- Setting: DIFFERENT UK room but similar aesthetic (e.g., bedroom nook)

PIN 3 - WIDE ENVIRONMENTAL SHOT:
- Focus: Full scene showing pet, product, and complete British home setting
- Framing: Wide angle capturing room ambiance and lifestyle context
- Shows: Overall aesthetic, aspirational UK pet life, complete scene
- Example: "French Bulldog resting in grey orthopedic bed in bright conservatory with plants, showing full warm British home interior"
- Breed: DIFFERENT from Pins 1 & 2 (e.g., French Bulldog, Beagle, British Shorthair)
- Setting: DIFFERENT UK space with same cohesive look (e.g., conservatory, kitchen corner, hallway)

BREED VARIETY (use different breeds across the 3 pins):
- Popular UK breeds: Labrador, Cocker Spaniel, French Bulldog, Beagle, Border Terrier, Springer Spaniel
- UK cats: British Shorthair, Tabby, Ginger cat, Tortoiseshell

UK SETTINGS VARIETY (different rooms, same aesthetic):
- Terraced house living room
- Cottage bedroom
- Modern flat kitchen
- Victorian home hallway
- Conservatory with plants
- Garden room
- Utility room
- Home office nook
```

**Impact:** Clear framework for close/mid/wide with examples for each

### BEFORE (Original Prompt)
```
VISUAL QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Style: Editorial pet lifestyle, warm, realistic British homes

Example breeds: Labrador, Cocker Spaniel, French Bulldog, Beagle, British Shorthair, Tabby
