# MCP & Skills Integration - Conversation Log
**Date:** December 31, 2024
**Status:** PINNED - To explore in detail when time allows
**Priority:** High interest but requires focused session

---

## CONTEXT

During today's session, we discussed MCP (Model Context Protocol) and Skills integration for automation. This is something you're very interested in pursuing but acknowledged it's too complex for a quick 5-minute chat.

---

## WHAT WAS DISCUSSED

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Tool for connecting Claude to external systems and data sources
- Could automate workflows between different platforms
- Potential for Shopify integration, email automation, etc.

### Skills
- Custom automation capabilities
- Could streamline repetitive tasks
- Integration possibilities with your existing tools (Shopify, Make.com, etc.)

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

You mentioned wanting to explore this because:
1. **Automation potential** - Could save significant time on repetitive tasks
2. **Workflow optimization** - Better integration between tools
3. **Scalability** - Set up systems once, use repeatedly
4. **Future-proofing** - Stay ahead with automation capabilities

---

## CURRENT BLOCKERS

1. **Time required** - This needs a dedicated, focused session (not a quick chat)
2. **Complexity** - Requires understanding setup, configuration, and integration
3. **Current priorities** - Shopify store launch prep is more urgent right now

---

## WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

- Properly explore MCP capabilities
- Understand Skills integration
- Plan automation workflows
- Set up systems that work for your business
- **Not rush it** - do it properly when you have time and focus

---

## WHEN TO REVISIT

**Ideal timing:**
- After Shopify store launch is complete
- When you have 1-2 hours for a focused session
- When immediate fires are out and you can think strategically

**Prerequisites:**
- Store launched and stable
- Main automations (emails, reviews) working
- Time to explore without pressure

---

## NEXT STEPS (When Ready)

1. **Schedule dedicated session** - Block out 1-2 hours
2. **Research preparation** - Look at MCP documentation beforehand
3. **Define use cases** - What specific workflows do you want to automate?
4. **Prioritize integrations** - Which tools/platforms matter most?
5. **Implementation plan** - Step-by-step setup guide

---

## RESOURCES TO EXPLORE

(To be added when we start this conversation properly)

- MCP documentation
- Skills SDK documentation
- Integration examples
- Use case templates

---

## RELATED CONVERSATIONS

- Make.com automation workflows (discussed in previous sessions)
- Blog automation strategy
- Pinterest automation
- Email sequences

All of these could potentially benefit from MCP/Skills integration.

## USER NOTES

**Your quote:** "i really want to do that, but it seems alot to go through which we cant in a 5 min chat so pin that as well please"

**Translation:** This is important, don't let it get lost, but respect that it needs proper time and attention - not a rushed session.

---

## TOMORROW'S BRAIN DUMP

You mentioned doing a "mini brain dump on stuff i dont want us loose focus on so we keep on track" tomorrow.

**Action:** Add MCP/Skills to that brain dump if relevant, or keep it separate as a future strategic project.

**Status:** PINNED - Waiting for the right time
**Reminder:** Don't rush this. Do it properly when you have the time and headspace.
