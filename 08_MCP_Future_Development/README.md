# MCP & Future Development

**Status:** Planning phase - to be revisited after Extension audit
**Created:** December 30, 2024

## Overview

This folder contains planning and development for:
1. **MCP Servers** - Giving Claude extra powers (analytics, calendars, APIs)
2. **Autonomous Agents** - Specialized workers for content, research, monitoring
3. **Dashboard/Command Center** - Project tracking system for HappyPawsCo

- Google Analytics integration

### 2. Autonomous Agents

- Landing Page Optimizer Agent

### 3. Dashboard/Command Center
- Content calendar for Pinterest & blogs
- Product launch tracker

## Priority

**After Extension audit is complete**, we'll return to this and:
1. Decide which MCPs to set up first
2. Choose dashboard tool (Airtable/Notion/Sheets)
3. Build first agent (likely Content Research or Pinterest)
4. Create systematic workflow

---

## Notes from Initial Discussion

**User Context:**
- Not a coder, needs no-code/low-code solutions
- Managing HappyPawsCo with multiple moving parts
- Needs system to track content calendar, campaigns, products
- Open to agent-based automation for repetitive tasks

**Constraints:**
- No custom SaaS development (too complex)
- Focus on existing tools + Claude integration
- Simple, maintainable solutions

## Next Steps (When We Return)

1. [ ] Choose dashboard tool
2. [ ] Set up content calendar structure
3. [ ] Configure first MCP
4. [ ] Build first agent
5. [ ] Test and iterate

---

**Status:** On hold until Extension audit complete
