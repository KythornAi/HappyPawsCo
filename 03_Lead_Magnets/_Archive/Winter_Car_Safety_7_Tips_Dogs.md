## Making Winter Journeys Safe and Stress-Free

Winter car journeys with your dog can feel like a challenge. Between the cold, dark mornings, and your pup's potential anxiety about the car, it's enough to make you want to stay home.

But here's the good news: with a few simple preparations, winter car travel can be safe, comfortable, and stress-free for both of you.

This guide shares seven essential tips to keep your furry friend safe and legal on UK roads this winter – from proper restraints to dealing with anxiety.

## Tip 1: Use a Proper Car Restraint (It's the Law!)

### What to do:
Secure your dog using a crash-tested harness with an ISOFIX tether, or a properly fitted car crate. Under Highway Code Rule 57, dogs must be suitably restrained in vehicles.

### Why it works:
A proper restraint prevents your dog from becoming a projectile in sudden stops or accidents. It also stops them from distracting you while driving – which could lead to fines or, worse, an accident.

### Pro tip:
Look for harnesses specifically designed for car use, like the Kurgo Tru-Fit Harness with ISOFIX tether. These distribute force across the chest rather than the neck, keeping your dog safer in an emergency.

### Common mistake to avoid:
Don't rely on regular walking harnesses or leads for car travel. They're not designed to withstand impact forces and can actually harm your dog in a collision.

## Tip 2: Warm Up the Car Before Loading Your Dog

### What to do:
Start your car and run the heater for 5-10 minutes before bringing your dog out on cold winter mornings. Make sure the back seats are warm to touch.

### Why it works:
Dogs feel the cold just like we do, especially short-haired breeds and older dogs with arthritis. A cold car can make the journey uncomfortable and increase anxiety.

### Pro tip:
If your dog is particularly sensitive to cold, consider a dog car hammock or blanket for the back seat. This adds an extra layer of warmth and comfort for winter journeys.

### Common mistake to avoid:
Don't blast hot air directly at your dog. Keep the temperature comfortable (not tropical) and ensure good air circulation throughout the car.

## Tip 3: Never Leave Your Dog Alone in a Cold Car

### What to do:
If you need to stop during your journey, take your dog with you or ensure someone stays in the car with the heating on. Even "just 5 minutes" can be dangerous.

### Why it works:
Cars lose heat rapidly in winter. What feels mildly cool to you can become dangerously cold for a dog, especially smaller breeds or those with thin coats.

### Pro tip:
Plan your winter journeys to minimise stops. If you must make stops, choose dog-friendly locations where your pup can come inside with you (many UK cafes and shops now welcome dogs).

### Common mistake to avoid:
Don't assume your dog's fur coat will keep them warm enough. Many breeds weren't designed for British winters, and a stationary cold car offers no protection from the elements.

## Tip 4: Pack a Winter Car Safety Kit

### What to do:
Keep a dedicated dog emergency kit in your car containing:
- Warm blanket
- Extra lead and collar
- Water and collapsible bowl
- High-visibility jacket or collar light
- First aid basics
- Your vet's phone number

### Why it works:
Winter weather is unpredictable. If you break down or get stuck in traffic, having supplies on hand keeps your dog safe and comfortable until help arrives.

### Pro tip:
Include a few of your dog's favourite treats. These can help keep them calm if you're delayed, and they're useful for positive reinforcement if your dog gets anxious during the journey.

### Common mistake to avoid:
Don't wait until you need the kit to pack it. Assemble it now while you're thinking about it, and check it every few months to replace any expired items.

## Tip 5: Manage Car Anxiety with Gradual Exposure

### What to do:
If your dog shows signs of car anxiety (panting, whining, drooling), start with short positive experiences. Sit in the parked car with treats, then progress to short drives around the block before attempting longer winter journeys.

### Why it works:
Car anxiety often stems from negative associations or motion sickness. Gradual, positive exposure helps your dog build confidence and creates new, happier associations with the car.

### Pro tip:
Never feed your dog a large meal right before a car journey. A light snack 2-3 hours before travel can help prevent motion sickness, which often worsens anxiety.

### Common mistake to avoid:
Don't only use the car for vet visits. Make sure some car journeys lead to fun destinations like the park or beach, so your dog doesn't associate the car purely with stressful experiences.

## Tip 6: Ensure Proper Visibility and Lighting

### What to do:
In winter's darker mornings and evenings, make sure your dog is visible if you need to let them out during a journey. Use a high-visibility harness, LED collar, or reflective lead.

### Why it works:
If you need to stop on a dark road (breakdown, emergency), a visible dog is a safer dog. Other drivers can see them, and you can spot them more easily.

### Pro tip:
Keep a small torch in your car emergency kit. It's useful for checking on your dog, inspecting their harness, or dealing with any roadside situations in the dark.

### Common mistake to avoid:
Don't assume your car's interior light is enough. If you're pulled over on a dark road, you need proper visibility both inside and outside the car.

## Tip 7: Check Paws and Coat After Winter Journeys

### What to do:
After arriving at your destination, quickly check your dog's paws for ice, grit, or salt. Wipe them clean and check the coat for dampness, especially if they've been in and out of the car during wet weather.

### Why it works:
Road salt and grit can irritate or damage paw pads. Damp coats can lead to chills, especially if your dog has been in a warm car and then goes into a cold environment.

### Pro tip:
Keep pet-safe paw balm in your car during winter. A quick application before and after journeys creates a protective barrier against salt and ice.

### Common mistake to avoid:
Don't let your dog lick their paws right after a winter walk or car journey. Road salt and de-icing chemicals can upset their stomach or worse.
