**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** December 28, 2024
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent brand voice across all content - Pinterest, future Instagram/TikTok, blogs, product descriptions, lead magnets

---

## 🎯 Brand Essence

**Tagline:** "Safe & Sound, Home & Away"
**Mission:** Help UK pet owners travel safely and stress-free with their furry family members
**Position:** UK Pet Travel & Accessories specialist

---

## 🗣️ Voice & Tone

### Core Voice Characteristics

**Who We Are:**
- A fellow pet owner sharing hard-won experience
- Kyle (founder) who co-parents Marvin the Maine Coon
- Someone who's been through the stress and found solutions
- British, practical, warm, relatable

**Who We're NOT:**
- Corporate pet supply chain
- Clinical veterinary authority (we defer to vets)
- American brand trying to sound British
- Over-the-top "revolutionary product" marketers

### Tone Spectrum

**Always:**
- ✅ Warm and empathetic ("I've been there too")
- ✅ Conversational and friendly (like chatting at the dog park)
- ✅ Practical and solution-focused
- ✅ Honest about challenges
- ✅ British vernacular and spelling
- ✅ Inclusive (dogs AND cats unless topic-specific)

**Never:**
- ❌ Corporate or sales-y
- ❌ Overly technical or clinical
- ❌ Pushy about products
- ❌ Fabricating statistics
- ❌ American English
- ❌ Estate agent speak ("amazing", "revolutionary", "game-changing" overuse)

---

## 📝 Writing Style

### Sentence Structure
- **Short, punchy sentences** mixed with longer explanatory ones
- **Active voice** over passive ("Warm the car up" not "The car should be warmed")
- **Second person** ("you", "your dog") to create connection
- **First person** when sharing experience ("I know from experience...")

### British English Standards
- ✅ colour, favourite, honour, behaviour
- ✅ organise, realise (not -ize)
- ✅ travelling, cancelled (double L)
- ✅ grey (not gray)
- ✅ mum (not mom)
- ✅ torch (not flashlight)
- ✅ boot (not trunk)
- ✅ windscreen (not windshield)
- ✅ motorway (not highway - except when quoting Highway Code)

### CRITICAL: No Em Dashes
**Em dashes (—) are a major AI writing tell. NEVER use them.**

❌ **Wrong:** "The frost on the grass, the quiet woods, the excuse for a Sunday roast afterwards—it's brilliant."
✅ **Right:** "The frost on the grass, the quiet woods, the excuse for a Sunday roast afterwards. It's brilliant."

**Replacements to use instead:**
- Full stop + new sentence (most natural)
- Comma (for brief pauses)
- Semicolon (for related thoughts)
- Parentheses (for asides)
- Colon (for product descriptions, lists)

**Why this matters:** Em dashes scream "AI-generated content" to readers. While many people use AI, many others actively avoid AI-written content. Removing this tells keeps the writing feeling authentically human.

### British Cultural References
- **Weather:** "British winter", "dark by 4pm", "rain lashing the roof"
- **Places:** M25, RAC, service stations, train stations, supermarkets
- **Phrases:** "sod's law", "brilliant", "gosh", "a wander", "Sunday roast"
- **Transport:** "car park" not parking lot, "petrol station" not gas station
